This is the second prompt in the course, requiring students to revise the existing prospectus for a literary exhibit, which will be mounted in the UVic's McPherson Library, in the Maltwood Gallery, together with other (e.g., web-based or online) components to be determined.

Aside from revising the prospectus, students add a section to it, giving them opportunities to articulate what and how they would like to contribute to the project.
