>###### ENGL 507 DIGITAL HUMANITIES, 74656

>I have had the opportunity to test and compare some of [William Turkel's](http://williamjturkel.net/how-to/ "Workflow for Digital Research") workflow suggestions for digital research to my current practices.  My workflow will emphasize searching for texts, storing information, and versioning writing.  Therefore, I have focused Turkel’s application suggestions for accelerating workflow in digital research to match my own academic needs. 
 
>While Turkel recommends, and at times seems to favor, the [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/central/ "Mozilla Firefox") web browser, I employ [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/browser/ "Google Chrome") for my workflow needs.  After installing Firefox and a few choice search extensions ([Project Gutenberg](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/project-gutenberg/ "Project Gutenberg"), [DeeperWeb](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/deeperweb-boost-and-customize-/ "DeeperWeb"), and [Internet Archive](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/internet-archive-search/ "Internet Archive")), I found some of the add-on features too cumbersome for daily productive work.  For instance, The Deeper Web add-on did refine my test search parameters; however, I found myself spending excessive time modifying tag clouds to obtain optimal search results.  A simple advanced search on Google provided the same results with less of a disturbance to my personal workflow.  Still, Turkel’s suggestion to capture RSS feeds using [Sage](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/sage/ "Sage") on Firefox proved quite useful.  Currently, I use [Google Reader](http://support.google.com/reader/answer/113517?hl=en& "Google Reader") and, experimentally, [Feedly](http://www.feedly.com/home#welcome "Feedly") to manage daily information.  The RSS drag-and-drop feature in Sage, along with the option layout and side-dock, made this RSS reader easily one of my favourites.  As I will be testing more Firefox add-ons than this week permitted, I will still keep the Firefox browser.  

>I currently use [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/ "Dropbox") and an external hard drive to backup my work and “Make Local Copies of Everything.”   I use Dropbox to effortlessly sync frequently accessed work between my desktop and my laptop computer.  My external hard drive automatically provides a daily backup of new materials and directories, functioning in the same capacity as Time Machine.  As an extra measure, I carry a USB drive to back up essential project files or semester work.  

>I purchased [Scrivener](http://literatureandlatte.com/ "Scrivener") for Windows to aid my writing this year.  Scrivener’s automatic two-second backups, snapshot versioning, full-screen text editing, and export options quickly made the software one of my favourite academic tools.  I keep a term binder with separate files for each class, project, and paper in Scrivener.  Before Scrivener, I worked with Microsoft Word exclusively.  Tracing multiple versions of one document in Microsoft Word required saving multiple word document files.  Although I prefer Scrivener in the writing process, I still use Microsoft Word to refine the draft version before print.  

>Turkel’s advice to file metadata on a bibliographic database using [Zotero](http://www.zotero.org/ "Zotero") or [Mendeley](http://www.mendeley.com/ "Mendeley") (options for Windows users) was not as useful for managing my research as the RefWorks Bibliographic database.  I found that Both Zotero (the Standalone) and Mendeley fail to match the functional layout of [RefWorks](http://www.refworks.com/ "RefWorks") while requiring additional set up and learning hours.  Exporting my test bibliography was much more challenging with the additional customization options available in Zotero Standalone.  Instead of manually configuring the bibliographic output, I take advantage of RefWorks’ simple “create bibliography” function.  RefWorks also cleanly integrates into Microsoft Word via [Write-N-Cite 4](http://www.refworks-cos.com/refworks/Write-n-Cite/ "Write-N-Cite RefWorks").  The same plug-ins for Mendeley and Zotero left remaining extensions running in Word.
