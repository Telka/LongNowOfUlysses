# SEMINAR FORMAT

Each of our seminar meetings will usually involve the following: 

* Lecture: I will speak for thirty to sixty minutes, introducing us to terms, histories, and issues for future discussion. 
* Workshop: For approximately sixty to ninety minutes, we will collectively experiment with a particular language, tool, platform, or approach related to digital literary studies. Between meetings, you will be asked to apply what you learned during these workshops. 
* Seminar Discussion: For fifteen to thirty minutes, we will chat as a group about the workshop and/or lecture. 

You should arrive to each meeting on time, having read the required texts, which are listed in the course outline.
