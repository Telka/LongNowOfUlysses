# Prospectus for “The Long Now of Ulysses”

Co-curated by Jentery Sayers, Stephen Ross, and English 507 (Spring 2013)

Author: Stephen Ross

## Rationale

“The Long Now of Ulysses” takes the modernist fascination with time and space as its cornerstone, using James Joyce’s modernist masterpiece Ulysses as a springboard for presentation of a rich context of historical, cultural, and aesthetic materials in a range of media. The exhibit takes Ulysses as its starting point for several reasons: we have it and are concluding the first-ever publication of it online, it’s perhaps the sine qua non of high modernist literary production (barring only The Waste Land), and it was at the very center of a dizzyingly productive time and place -- Paris in the 1910s and 1920s -- and formed part of the context for, and was contextualised by, virtually every significant aspect of modernist cultural production. As such, it is not simply an instance of modernism, but perhaps its key metonym: the part that can stand for the whole, directing us out from its centrality to the rich context in which it emerged and which it in turn helped shape. In this respect, and as the ongoing fascination with modernist aesthetics demonstrates (e.g., the popularity of Mad Men, the recent worldwide tour of the Vorticist exhibit), we remain firmly in the long now of Ulysses even today. This exhibit will extend this long now across media, times, and places to suggest ways in which we might still treat Ulysses as a springboard into the cultures of modernity and even postmodernity. This way the exhibit will encourage visitors to grapple with the novel and modernism as whole -  finding different ways the novel has/can be interacted with in the "The Long Now of Ulysses."

## Curation

The exhibit will be co-curated by Drs. Jentery Sayers and Stephen Ross, who will oversee the creative and collaborative contributions of the graduate students in Dr. Sayers' English 507 course (“Introduction to Digital Humanities”). The students will be responsible for developing the exhibit methodologies, including some use of intelligent environments and overcoming technological challenges. The faculty will be responsible for the content of the exhibit, and will provide content expertise, including selecting the materials to be displayed.

## Organization

The exhibit is organized into seventeen panels corresponding to the seventeen display cabinet sections arranged around the perimeter of the exhibit space, and in the six display cabinet sections located in the centre of the space. Each of the perimeter panels corresponds with an hour in the novel, whose episodes occur in approximately one-hour increments. The first panel will do double duty, displaying the hour of 8:00 am which is narrated twice in episodes 1 and 4 (first from Stephen Dedalus’s perspective and then from Leopold Bloom’s). The remaining panels will each correspond to a different hour and episode of the novel.

## Perimeter Panels

Each of the perimeter panels will be arranged around a large blow-up of twenty-two lines from a page in the novel. The pages have been chosen by applying an algorithm to the 1922 first edition of the novel as follows: given that the novel is set on June 16, 1904 and was published in 1922, we have taken 6, 16, and 22 as significant numbers. Starting with the first page of each episode, we counted six pages in and sixteen lines down from the top of the page to begin the excerpts we’ll blow up, and then excerpted 22 lines of text for the poster. This approach means that each panel is constituted by a given text whose significance is the product of a random process, just as modernist works of art increasingly turned to the everyday random experience of the city and rapid-fire technologies for their subject matter. Just as life itself began to feel as though it was blurring for many of the modernists in the first half of the twentieth century, so their works reflected an increased pace in which what Virginia Woolf called “moments of being” were more and more often accidental -- and accidents came to seem more and more significant of a higher order hidden behind superficial chaos. Our method of selecting the passages to blow up for the exhibit mimics this experience, treating Ulysses itself as an apparently chaotic welter from which order and significance can be extracted even when -- perhaps especially when -- the particular encounter is itself randomized.

The blown-up text is only a springboard, an anchor, for each panel, though, and the exhibit places a premium upon moving beyond the textual alone in its displays. As the attached layout indicates, each panel will feature contextual materials that call out from the posterized excerpts:

1. using a quotation from later in the book and/or a later work that evokes it, we will provide historical context for the passage, the novel, and modernism more broadly. Format: text and/or reproduced photographs or images.
2. we will link the passage to a character in the novel, his or her historical basis, and the broader network of modernist cultural production in which they participated (and which participated in the production of Ulysses by proxy)
3. a visual art work that corresponds or evokes/is evoked by the passage will be hung proximate to the blown-up excerpt from the novel; these works will be selected primarily from the UVAC for their aesthetic correspondence and/or their implication in the network of cultural production that circulated around Joyce and his Ulysses. The Gisèle Freund photographs of Paris in the 1920s and 1930s will be of particular interest here, as will the UVAC's Klimt silkscreen and other materials in that vein (all depending upon availability and permission).
4. an object or artifact that has been reproduced in 3D; these objects will be selected based upon their appearance in the novel, their contextual importance, and their interest factor as historical objects. We will model the objects from existing digital models/scans or scan objects from museum collections to which we have been given access (including UVAC) for this purpose. The objects will be printed on a MakerBot 3D printer (housed in the Maker Lab at UVic) in a resinous material, meaning that they can be freely handled by visitors to the exhibit without fear of damage or loss (should either occur, we will simply print replacements).  
5. other texts that are evoked by/evoke the blown-up passage will themselves be presented in smaller blow-up excerpts and, where possible, in the original or rare editions held by Special Collections (in the locked display cases). At a minimum these will include rare editions of Ulysses, but also works by Wyndham Lewis, T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, John Betjeman, Herbert Read, Amelia Laracuen, letters, diaries, advertisements, newspaper pages (we have the 1904 Freeman, e.g.), etc.  

## Center Cabinets

The six cabinets located in the center of the space are organized according to the principle of unanticipated afterlives. These panels will feature creative interventions on behalf of the developers of the exhibit, further explore ideas raised in other panels, and/or explore ways Ulysses has been taken up by artists and thinkers. An emphasis will be put on how "The Long Now" has been facilitated by the copyright trials and other court cases had on the novels public reputation. The center cabinets also present a space to be to untangle the notorious image the novel has amassed from impressions of its complexity/difficulty.


## Sound of the Exhibit


The sound of the exhibit will reflect "The Long Now of Ulysses" by developing a piece in MAX/MSP that connects the audible dimension of the text to the underlying formal decisions and content of the exhibit. The piece also attempts engaging the audience to interact with the various elements of the exhibit. The piece will act as organization system working with 22 audio samples, 16 processes and 6 ways for viewers to interact with the exhibit or for the exhibit to react to the audience. The audio samples will link to the sections of Ulysses chosen for each panel or present other related historical material. This could entail audio recordings of soundscapes depicted in the text (ex. newspaper printing office or pubs), the many songs referenced in the novel, readings of the novel or dramatizations of the dialog, or music fitting the period and/or modernist aesthetic. The processes control what is happening at any given time such as fading samples in or out, moving samples spatially, layering the samples dynamically, manipulating/transforming the sounds, or exerting agency on what is happening in the piece. The piece is intended to encourage the audience to interact with the exhibit in specific ways as well as react to the audience's engagement. The audience can actively interact with the piece by annotating/arranging a touch screen version of the Ulysses excerpts, interacting with objects within the exhibit,  or selecting sounds they want to hear from a display. The piece reacts to how long the audience spends at a specific part of the space, the volume of their conversations, or how many people are in the space at a given time. Each of the interactions or reactions control how the piece's processes are carried out. With reactivity and interactivity the "Long Now of Ulysses" is continued into digital art by furthering the exploration of the relation between form and content initiated by the novel.
