# DESCRIPTION

Digital literary studies (DLS) are frequently associated with not only the production and interpretation of literature through computational means but also an investment in how literature changes both with and through digital culture, networks, and collaborations. For instance, Alan Liu claims that—in DLS—“everything old and new is up for grabs again,” as scholars, artists, and an array of publics negotiate the tensions between imagination and simulation, writing and encoding, reading and browsing, mimesis and modelling, and publication and transmission. Since this seminar is an introduction to DLS, it gives students opportunities to explore a variety of methods and perspectives, and it is intended for students who are absolutely new to—and even skeptical of—digital humanities. The seminar’s design assumes that digital literary studies (in particular) and digital humanities (in general) are best understood through tacit knowledge production and praxis. Such an assumption means that we will combine knowing and doing, resisting the prevalent-but-fallacious divide between the technical and theoretical, digital and analog media, handiwork and mental labour, bodies and information.

More specifically, we will be collaborating as a group to prototype, test, implement, and publish a single project: a distributed literary exhibit located, in part, in the UVic’s McPherson Library. This process will involve our collaborating with other faculty and graduate students as well as librarians, para-academics, and a variety of web-oriented and local audiences. We have no choice. The exhibit must go live, just in time for Congress 2013 at the UVic. Nevertheless, its design, content, materiality, and modes of expression and delivery are yet to be determined. What we do have is infrastructure, interest, and support. And by the semester’s end, each of you will be named a co-curator of the exhibit, having contributed a component of it and—in the process—learning methodologies anchored in the modelling, versioning, visualization, curation, and expression of data. That said, the seminar affords a significant degree of creative and critical license on your part, balanced by the collective expectation that you document your process, reflect on your contributions, and consider how the exhibit will function after English 507. In so doing, I will request that you repeatedly ask the following questions of and for digital literary studies: what are the practices of culture in our “digital” moment? By whom? For whom? Under what assumptions? And to what effects on the interpretation and trajectories of both literature and literary criticism? 

Technical competencies assumed by this seminar: That you know how to send an email.

# COURSE OBJECTIVES 

By the seminar’s end, you will be expected to: 

+ Thoroughly document the iterative development of your learning using a distributed revision control system, 
+ Review the work of other digital humanities practitioners, provide feedback on that work, and evaluate it, 
+ Effectively model your own humanities data and articulate its curation plan, 
+ Persuasively present your work during a public roundtable consisting of at least three people, 
+ Collaboratively produce a public exhibit, which meaningfully engages and somehow intervenes in digital literary studies, and 
+ Produce a portfolio, narrative, and statement that collectively demonstrate your critical awareness of digital methods and literary project development.  

In terms of competencies for conducting digital literary studies, you should gain familiarity with:

+ Data modelling, 
+ Data curation, provenance, and interoperability, 
+ Data visualization and expression,
+ Text analysis,
+ Revision control and versioning,  
+ Usability and interface design, 
+ Using established guidelines to peer-review digital projects, and 
+ Culture- and community-based planning and design strategies.  

# SEMINAR FORMAT

Each of our seminar meetings will usually involve the following: 

* Lecture: I will speak for thirty to sixty minutes, introducing us to terms, histories, and issues for future discussion. 
* Workshop: For approximately sixty to ninety minutes, we will collectively experiment with a particular language, tool, platform, or approach related to digital literary studies. Between meetings, you will be asked to apply what you learned during these workshops. 
* Seminar Discussion: For fifteen to thirty minutes, we will chat as a group about the workshop and/or lecture. 

You should arrive to each meeting having read the required texts, which are listed in the course outline.  

# REQUIRED TEXTS, TOOLS, and PLATFORMS 	
There is no textbook for this seminar. All readings are available online and will be disseminated via links from the course website. Most readings are also open access. That said, you are not required to purchase any books or journal issues. Since most of the technologies we will be using are free and open source, you will also not be required to purchase any tools, apps, or platforms (even though I might recommend some that are not free but are worth purchasing for research purposes).

# ASSESSMENT 

Projects in this seminar are expected to be well-researched (making use of sources that are additional to any research bibliography that I may have provided), appropriately documented following the MLA bibliographic style, carefully proofread, and professionally presented. 

Letter grades will be assigned based on the following scale: 

90-100 = A+ 		

> Projects in this range are especially sophisticated and perceptive 
pieces of work that make an original contribution to scholarship. They could be published in a peer-reviewed scholarly journal.  

85-89 = A 		

> Projects in this range are perceptive and original, but may require 
substantial revision for publication in a scholarly journal. They would normally be accepted as conference presentations. 

80-84 = A- 		

> Projects in this range are adequate on the graduate level both with 
regard to the quality of content and writing and to research and presentation. 

77-79 = B+ 		

> Projects in this range have significant weaknesses in some areas, 
though still meet graduate standards.

73-76 = B		

>Projects in this range are marginally acceptable at graduate level.  

# ASSIGNMENTS

Below is a list of the assignments for this seminar, together with a description of what is expected for each. Please note that the requirements are subject to minor changes as the seminar progresses. If I do make a change to any of the assignments, then I will notify you in writing and well in advance

The final project and the final presentation are essential for passing the course. Failure to complete these requirements will result in a failing N grade (calculated as a 0 for your GPA).  

Please also note: I do not post marks outside my office. 

## Log (40%)

Throughout the semester, you will keep a log documenting the iterative development of your learning and your contributions to the literary exhibit. Consisting of several relatively short contributions, your log will be visible to everyone else in the seminar, and you will be expected to comment on contributions published by your peers. I will openly comment on your logs, but marks will never be publicly posted. Your log will be assessed holistically, meaning your work will be given one grade (at the semester’s end) based on its: (1) consistency; (2) development over time; (3) integration of seminar discussions, lectures, and workshops; (4) quality; (5) attention to change; and (6) ultimate relation to your contributions to the literary exhibit. There will be a prompt for each entry in your log, and it will be related to a particular workshop and/or lecture. It will be circulated at least one week prior to its due date. Log entries should be submitted before seminar on the day they are due. If, at any point after our sixth meeting in the term, you would like an interim grade for your log, then feel free to ask. My intention for holistically assessing your log is not to keep you in the dark about your academic progress. It is to treat a log as it should be treated: as a genre that develops and increases in complexity over time. Please note that the tone and style of your logs can be less formal than, say, a seminar essay intended for an academic audience. Where applicable, logs should also be self-aware and reflective in character.  

Though subject to change, the log will consist of at least the following entries: (1) workflow, (2) thought piece, (3) needs assessment, (4) outcomes statement, (5) data model, (6) draft exhibit components (two iterations), and (7) final presentation materials.  

## Final Project (30%)

As per the course description, each of you will contribute to a literary exhibit, which will be mounted (in part) in McPherson Library for Congress 2013. Since the exhibit will involve in situ as well as web-based and distributed components, what exactly you contribute will be largely at your discretion. I encourage you to work in small groups, especially since we will be collaborating as a class to help make the exhibit happen. 

Given the range of possibilities afforded by this approach to digital literary studies, final projects—as more or less “modular” components that can be collectively integrated into the final instantiation of the literary exhibit—will probably vary from student to student, or at least across groups of students. 

With that in mind, each project (regardless of which component you contribute) must involve the following: (1) a portfolio including screengrabs and other documentation of your contributions to the literary exhibit, (2) a 1000- to 1500-word narrative explaining and justifying your contributions, (3) a 500- to 1000-word reflection statement on what practices met your expectations and what surprised you, (4) a 250- to 500-word statement for future development, including what aspects of your contributions (in particular) and the exhibit (in general) you and others could and should develop with more time and resources, and (5) a bibliography. The key aspect of your final project is that it should emerge throughout the semester, anchored largely in your logs. Put differently: I recommend you document everything for both future reference and possible integration into your portfolio and its related statements and narratives. 

The final project can be submitted in whatever format you prefer: a DOCX file, HTML, a website, or transmedia (e.g., a combination of video and text-based narrative). At some point in the semester, I recommend consulting with me on your approach. Where necessary, I am happy to provide you with resources and to even offer tutorials / workshops when student interest in a particular approach is significant.  

While you are more than encouraged to collaborate with others on your contributions to a particular component of the exhibit, your final project should be authored individually (even if it references and builds upon what others contributed to your work and to the exhibit itself). Persuasive projects will integrate, augment, and complicate peer contributions to the literary exhibit.      

## Final Presentation (15%)

Your final presentation will assume the form of a collaborative roundtable, consisting of at least three people in the seminar and conducted during our last meeting of the semester. People from outside the seminar will be invited. Roundtables of three will last thirty minutes, and (if necessary) roundtables of four will last forty minutes. Each will have a question-and-answer period. By “collaborative” roundtable, I mean its design and implementation should be collaborative in character. How you present (including content, style, and technologies used) is up to you. However, please keep in mind two things: (1) you should reflect on and assess what you learned during the entire seminar (meaning it is not solely about your final project), and (2) everyone participating in your roundtable will be given the same grade (meaning collaboration is key). Please do not use the roundtable as an opportunity to only read text from your final projects.

## Regular Presentations (or Group Reports) (15%) 

Throughout the semester, during seminar you will be asked to give brief (i.e., two- to three-minute) and informal reports on the status of your contributions to the exhibit. Most of these will assume the form of group reports, where you will update us on the work you are doing with others (who share interests or are even collaborating with you). Ideally, these groups will emerge organically. Where necessary, I will organize them based on affinities. For each report, I will provide written and/or verbal feedback, almost always immediately after your presentation. The intended audience for these presentations is not, say, an audience at an academic conference. You should instead present with those of us in the seminar in mind. No need to write something and read it. And you should not over-prepare. Just be ready to tell us what you have been doing, what problems and curiosities have emerged, and to what effects. When possible, point us to evidence or documentation (e.g., on the web). 

# POLICIES

## Late Submissions

Barring exceptional circumstances, I will not accept your Final Projects after the due date. Belated log entries will negatively influence your final Log grade. Since log entries are intended to build upon each other, I recommend that you do not fall behind on the entries. Also, I will not comment on entries submitted after the due date. 

The Final Roundtable can only occur during the final meeting of the semester. 

## Absences

Weekly attendance in graduate courses is expected. If you must be absent from a course for a serious reason, then you should contact me before the missed class and explain why you will not be in attendance. Cases of continuous, unexplained absence will result in a penalty to your grade or your ineligibility to complete the course. Attendance and active participation in discussions and workshops are part of fulfilling the course requirements. I will notify the Graduate Adviser if you have three or more unwarranted absences.  

## Laptops 

Laptops are welcome in the seminar. In fact, if you have one, then I recommend bringing it to each meeting. It will be especially useful during workshops.  

## Extensions

No extensions will be given except in extreme—and verifiable—circumstances. These circumstances include reasons of health and extenuating circumstances such as death of a family member. 

## Learning Climate

The University of Victoria is committed to promoting, providing, and protecting a positive, supportive, and safe working and learning environment for all its members. Students and faculty members are expected to adhere to the UVic human rights policy. Students should alert me immediately if they have any questions about this policy and its application, or if they have concerns about course proceedings or participants.

## Academic Integrity

Students are expected to adhere to the [UVic academic integrity policy] (http://web.uvic.ca/calendar2011/FACS/UnIn/UARe/PoAcI.html). Violations of this policy will result in a failing grade for the given assignment and may additionally result in a failing grade for the course. By taking this course, students agree that all submitted assignments may be subject to an originality review. I do not use software to detect plagiarism in essays or any other assignments.  

## Accessibility 

Students with diverse learning styles and needs are welcome in this course. In particular, if you have a disability/health consideration that may require accommodations, please feel free to approach me and/or the Resource Centre for Students with a Disability (RCSD) as soon as possible. RCSD staff is available by appointment to assess specific needs, provide referrals and arrange appropriate accommodations. The sooner you let us know your needs, the sooner we can assist you in achieving your learning goals in this course.

## Email 

With the exception of holidays and weekends, I respond to student emails within twenty-four hours.
