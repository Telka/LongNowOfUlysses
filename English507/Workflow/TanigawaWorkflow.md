# Prompt 1: 
## Workflow

After reading Turkel’s [article](http://williamjturkel.net), my first thought was, “I wish I had read this *years* ago.” Practicing Turkel’s suggestions proved less of an exercise in [kaizen](http://williamjturkel.net/2011/04/05/measure-refactor/) and more of an exercise in complete workflow overhaul. Not only did he highlight the importance of coherent workflows, he offered key strategies for making sure the workflow, from research to writing, is effective.  For example, I’m currently using [Scrivener](http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php) to see if this is a productive way to save and cluster both small and large assignments and projects.  Even his search engine strategies such as trying different search engines and using the advanced search page to yield different results, while seemingly basic tips, are strategies I often forget.
   
Beginning with the [browser](http://williamjturkel.net), I installed [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/) and Safari and plan to add Firefox in order to test website compatibility. However, in order to streamline my basic workflow process, I plan to use [Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/) regularly. After reading Turkel’s article, I installed Safari extensions for [Evernote](http://evernote.com/webclipper/) and [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org). While I’m not a fan of Zotero for producing reliable work cited lists, I am open to trying it as a basic and easy to access list of sources. 

Turkel has a a few backup and versioning strategies that he uses at once, including: 

* [Time Machine](https://www.apple.com/ca/osx/apps/#time-machine), 
* [DropBox][], 
* [Jungle Disk](https://www.jungledisk.com), and 
* [GitHub](https://github.com). 

Is it a bad move to just use one, namely GitHub? I currently use DropBox  alongside subversion to back up my files for the MVP, however, from the little I’ve seen of GitHub, I simply like GitHub better. The latter program seems easier to use than subversion for backing up items on a daily basis (i.e. does not require you to deal with a command line), you can have several projects on the go, and you can easily share these projects with others. It seems as easy to use as DropBox and has Subversion’s ability to version documents. 

Prior to Turkel’s article, I did not have an RSS feed for research. I used to use [Google Reader](http://www.google.ca/reader/view/) when working as a poverty advocate to ensure I was up to date on legislation changes, related events, etc., but never considered it for academic research purposes. Needless to say, I’ve reinstated my use of google reader \(though [Kirkpatrick’s video](http://marshallk.com/5-minute-intro-to-yahoo-pipes) on [Yahoo Pipes](http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/) made that seem like the tool to use\). With my Evernote extension, I can clip relevant articles and systematically file them in a searchable, digital, cloud-based repository. As per digitizing everything, Turkel makes a good point. It may be time consuming on the front end, but it saves time in the long run for longterm research projects. 

What considering my workflow highlighted for me was a desire for simplicity. I want: 
* one program to write in \(Scrivener\), 
* one program to store research material both locally and in a cloud \(Evernote\), 
* and one program to back up and version material \(GitHub\). 

His other suggestions such as using the IRISPen, bursting documents, and using a spider seemed a bit excessive for my simple research purposes.
