## Log \#\1: Workflow  

I have decided to take this course to shed some of my antiquated and inefficient habits. My present workflow involves me printing everything and annotating it manually using a colour codification system that can only be deciphered by me. It is a workflow that winds up obfuscating the texts I use more than it clarifies them. I concede that its time to find a more efficient way of harnessing, sorting, and revisiting the useful information contained in my sources.  
   
I decided to use [Firefox](http://goo.gl/M8UwS) as my primary research browser because it is the browser that I am most familiar with. I find the search add-ons to be a convenient supplement to Firefox. I downloaded search add-ons such as: 
*[DeeperWeb](http://goo.gl/h0NcM) 
*[Project Gutenberg](http://goo.gl/2mZ5L) 
*[Google Books](http://goo.gl/DeYMT) 
*[Amazon](http://goo.gl/RvZv5)   
to help me find free digital books and [WorldCat](http://goo.gl/rfSR7) to help me find important texts that cannot be found in the University of Victoria library. Additionally, I decided to download [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/) for my leisure browsing. While the applications I have added to Firefox render it a labour-saving forum for performing research, they also slow it down. Therefore, Chrome will be my go-to browser when I do not need to use any of the ‘extra stuff’ that might hinder Firefox. It will also serve as an additional interface through which I can view web-content.  

I have configured my laptop so that [Time Machine](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1427) backs up my computer to an external hard drive whenever I plug the hard drive into my computer. I already use [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) to remotely access files and share files with others. It acts as cloud storage for files that are particularly important to preserve and also ones that I might be editing at various locations on the fly.  

To clip useful content from the web, and to sort, tag, annotate, edit and manage research notes I will use [Evernote](http://evernote.com/). Evernote’s interface is pleasant to look at, and I also find it to be very intuitive to navigate. With Evernote I can impose a hierarchy of organization on clipped web content; it compartmentalizes and allows me to search and annotate my clipped content. Furthermore, when I clip something in Evernote is not ephemeral in the way that a bookmarked page is. How could I possibly think about bookmarking again?  

In terms of word processing, I didn’t think that [Turkel](http://williamjturkel.net/how-to/) would be able to tear me away from Microsoft Word—not because I think it’s particularly amazing, but because it is all I’ve ever known. However, after watching an introductory tutorial on Scrivener, I think I have changed my mind. I like the way that [Scrivener](http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php) allows you to plan, edit and compartmentalize a document.  
   
Reading Turkel’s article has confirmed for me that my present workflow wastes a lot of labour and resources. It does not—because it cannot—exploit the resources I engage with to their full potential. However, I am reluctant to convert my present scholarly labour process to a digital one. I love being able to hold a book in my hand, flip the pages and navigate textual material in three dimensions. I feel, especially when working with primary sources, that engaging with the material book preserves the original context in which the book would have been read, at least to some extent. Ideally, I would investigate sources in as many forms and forums as possible so as to prevent myself from being subject to the ideologies being promoted by the software I use—unless that is the point at issue.  
 
Even though a material book cannot adapt to a rapidly changing body of knowledge in the way that online content can, I’m not sure that any degree of convenience or plasticity warrants dismissing the importance of the material book. That said, it also strikes me that clipping content from the Web might contribute to a stale quality in scholarly work (similar to the way that using an out of date book might), unless the clipped content is used more or less immediately after it is clipped.  

As I am writing this I wonder if my reluctance to ‘go digital’ is grounded in my lack of familiarity with many of the tools I have been exploring over the past week. I will continue compile my Works Cited pages manually, but I am mandating myself to use as many of the programs and add-ons that Turkel recommends as I can throughout the term. While many of the programs Turkel recommends act as an extension of my memory and “Remember Everything” as Evernote’s slogan states, it is still my job to collate and comment on the material I gather in a way that unveils the purpose of my research—the technology is simply a new means to an end.
