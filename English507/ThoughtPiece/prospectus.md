# Prospectus for “The Long Now of Ulysses”

Co-curated by Jentery Sayers, Stephen Ross, and English 507 (Spring 2013)

Author: Stephen Ross 

## Rationale

“The Long Now of Ulysses” takes the modernist fascination with time and space as its cornerstone, using James Joyce’s modernist masterpiece Ulysses as a springboard for presentation of a rich context of historical, cultural, and aesthetic materials in a range of media. It will introduce visitors to the broad contexts of modernism even as it brings to light both the everyday content and the avant-garde stylistic dimensions of the novel. The exhibit takes Ulysses as its starting point for several reasons: we have it and are concluding the first-ever publication of it online, it’s perhaps the sine qua non of high modernist literary production (barring only The Waste Land), and it was at the very center of a dizzyingly productive time and place, and formed part of the context for, and was contextualised by, virtually every significant aspect of modernist cultural production. As such, it is not simply an instance of modernism, but perhaps its key metonym: the part that can stand for the whole, directing us out from its centrality to the rich context in which it emerged and which it, in turn, helped shape. In this respect, we remain fluidly in the long now of Ulysses even today. This exhibit will extend this long now across media, times, and spaces to suggest ways in which we might still treat Ulysses as a springboard into the cultures of modernity and even postmodernity. 

## Curation

The exhibit will be co-curated by Drs. Jentery Sayers and Stephen Ross, who will oversee the creative and collaborative contributions of the graduate students in Dr. Sayers' English 507 course (“Introduction to Digital Humanities”). The students will be responsible for developing the exhibit methodologies, including some use of intelligent environments and overcoming technological challenges. The faculty will be responsible for the content of the exhibit, and will provide content expertise, including selecting the materials to be displayed. 

## Organization

The exhibit is organized into seventeen panels corresponding to the seventeen display cabinet sections arranged around the perimeter of the exhibit space, and in the six display cabinet sections located in the centre of the space. Each of the perimeter panels corresponds with an hour in the novel, whose episodes occur in approximately one-hour increments. The first panel will do double duty, displaying the hour of 8:00 am which is narrated twice in episodes 1 and 4 (first from Stephen Dedalus’s perspective and then from Leopold Bloom’s). The remaining panels will each correspond to a different hour and episode of the novel. 

## Perimeter Panels 

Each of the perimeter panels will be arranged around a large blow-up of twenty-two lines from a page in the novel. The pages have been chosen by applying an algorithm to the 1922 first edition of the novel as follows: given that the novel is set on June 16, 1904 and was published in 1922, we have taken 06, 16, and 22 as significant numbers. Starting with the first page of each episode, we counted six pages in and sixteen lines down from the top of the page to begin the excerpts we’ll blow up, and then excerpted 22 lines of text for the poster. This approach means that each panel is constituted by a given text whose significance is the product of a random process, just as modernist works of art increasingly turned to the everyday random experience of the city and rapid-fire technologies for their subject matter. Just apparently as life itself began to feel as though it was blurring for many of the modernists in the first half of the twentieth century, so their works reflected an increased pace in which what Virginia Woolf called “moments of being” were more and more often accidental -- and accidents came to seem more and more significant of a higher order hidden behind superficial chaos. Our method of selecting the passages to blow up for the exhibit mimics this experience, treating Ulysses itself as an apparently chaotic welter from which order and significance can be extracted even when -- perhaps especially when -- the particular encounter is itself unpremeditated. 

The blown-up text is only a an anchor for each panel; the exhibit places a premium upon moving beyond the textual transmission lines alone in its displays. As the attached layout indicates, each panel will feature contextual materials that call out from the posterized excerpts: 

1. using a quotation from later in the book and/or a later work that evokes it, we will provide historical context for the passage, the novel, and modernism more broadly. Format: text and/or reproduced photographs,images, replicas. 
2. we will link the passage to a character in the novel, his or her historical basis, and the broader network of modernist cultural production in which they participated (and which participated in the production of Ulysses by proxy)
3. a visual art work that corresponds or evokes/is evoked by the passage will be hung proximate to the blown-up excerpt from the novel; these works will be selected primarily from the UVAC for their aesthetic correspondence and/or their implication in the network of cultural production that circulated around Joyce and his Ulysses. The Gisèle Freund photographs of Paris in the 1920s and 1930s will be of particular interest here, as will the UVAC's Klimt silkscreen and other materials in that vein (all depending upon availability and permission).  
4. an object or artifact that has been reproduced in 3D; these objects will be selected based upon their appearance in the novel, their contextual importance, and their interest factor as historical objects. We will model the objects from existing digital models/scans or scan objects from museum collections to which we have been given access (including UVAC) for this purpose. The objects will be printed on a MakerBot 3D printer (housed in the Maker Lab at UVic) in a resinous material, meaning that they can be freely handled by visitors to the exhibit without fear of damage or loss (should either occur, we will simply print replacements).  
5. sounds/music that correspond to the contexts will be available for playback. These will include historical recordings of soundscapes from the early twentieth century as well as songs, music, voices, readings, and machines. 
6. other texts that are evoked by/evoke the blown-up passage will themselves be presented in smaller blow-up excerpts and, where possible, in the original or rare editions held by Special Collections (in the locked display cases). At a minimum these will include rare editions of Ulysses, but also works by Wyndham Lewis, T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, John Betjeman, Herbert Read, Amelia Laracuen, letters, diaries, advertisements, newspaper pages (we have the 1904 Freeman, e.g.), etc.  

## Center Cabinets

The six cabinets located in the center of the space are organized according to the principle of unanticipated afterlives. They will feature works in which artists and critics have taken up Ulysses and its contexts in ways Joyce could not have anticipated: digital manifestations, cinematic renderings, live performances, architectural designs, artistic appropriations, inventive maps, music, etc. 

##Lines of Transmission

####(Transforming The Long Awaited into The Long Now of Ulysses)  

Drawing upon the "unanticipated afterlives" in/of Ulysses and the speculative rationale of "The Long Now" as a pensive and, admittedly, theoretical literary project, the exhibit will feature an artifact display which challenges the future of imaginings, materiality, and transmission of Ulysses.  Using the [plaque](http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/multimedia/display.cfm?Category=Spacecraft&IM_ID=8683 "Pioneer Plaque") of the [Pioneer 10](http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/missions/archive/pioneer.html "Pioneer Plaque") Satellite project as a source of ‘awaited’ inspiration, the Long Now of Ulysses will feature two crafted exhibit pieces:  

1. The design of a Ulysses plaque translating select passages of Ulysses through universal, “Long Now,” mediums and design.  Features of this plaque will translate Ulysses as an exhibit, text, and icon across human and non-human boundaries.  The Ulysses plaque seeks to decipher not only the Long Now of Ulysses exhibit, but also the significance and text of Joyce’s Ulysses using atomic [hyperfine](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/quantum/h21.html "Hyperfine Measurements").  As the Long Now of Ulysses employs a [“modernist fascination with time and space as its cornerstone”](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/blob/master/English507/ThoughtPiece/prospectus.md "Github Rationale"), this display piece will reposition today’s curated exhibit, as well as text from the 1922 first edition of the novel, into a truly universal medium.  

2. The design of a space micro-satellite capable of transmitting the Ulysses Satellite payload (a micro Ulysses plaque, the 1922 Ulysses text, and odd project ephemera manufactured at the University of Victoria) into Low Earth Orbit (LEO).  This exhibit piece is designed to complicate the stylistic space-time shifts in Ulysses (within Earth’s space-time), while speculating the possibility of new literary horizons.  The design will evolve from several commercial micro-satellite structures launched by the CSA (Canadian Space Agency) and various universities around the world.  

Each of these pieces is flexible enough to work around the perimeter and center panels in the exhibit.  A detailed rationale will accompany each piece to document the production, and theory, of this project.  To extend the limited space for the center panels, each exhibit piece may be suspended from the ceiling light supports using transparent monofilament line.
