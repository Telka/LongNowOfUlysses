# Zaqir Virani – Eng 507 Workflow
## Jan 15th 2013

   While I found [Turkel’s](http://www.williamjturkel.com "Turkel's Blog") advice to be fairly overwhelming, I  
	did come around to quite a few of his suggestions after some experimentation. In terms of browsers, I have 
	been using strictly Chrome as of late. The	extensions, however, were not as plentiful as those Turkel  
	advertised for Firefox. Considering this, I have re-installed  Firefox and some relevant search-engine extensions  
	(such as WorldCat, Gutenberg, and InternetArchive) as well as the Deep-Web search modifier. I’ve found that it is  
	much easier to cut through all the filler and questionable links by searching for a text directly through  
	WorldCat or Gutenberg. The Deep-Web modifier seems to be exceptionally useful in re-animating what would  
	normally seem to be dead-end queries. I do intend to continue using Chrome, however. The journals that I  
	monitor (via RSS feeds) link to Google Reader and work quite seamlessly with Chrome.  
	
 	My back-up strategy has always been quite simple, yet effective. Once a week, I update all word documents,  
	PDF’s, and .txt files of search queries and citations from my laptop onto an external drive. I also maintain  
	a DropBox account that cloud-stores the majority of my academic work. Aside from class work and research writing,  
	the majority of these backed-up files are local copies of material I am or have been working with or researching.  
	Whenever the option to do so is available, I download the PDF of an article and both print and back it up. When  
	such an option does not exist (in the case of hard copy, for example) I snapshot the pages with the app [ScanToPDF](http://www.androidmarket.com/scantopdf),  
	and then run the image through a third-party web app that OCR’s the document. Like a true luddite, I keep my  
	citational records by hand. I have several journals in which I record the bibliographic data of anything I  
	consult, along with the notes I make. These entries are indexed, numbered, and dated. After spending about 30  
	seconds exploring Zotero, however, I have begun to question this tedious process. For now, I will begin recording  
	the bibliographic information digitally, and then turn to my notebook. 
	
 	The app I turn to for writing is the ever-present Microsoft Word, simply because it’s what I grew up with, and it  
	has always been reliable and functional. That being said, Turkel has me itching to pony up for Scrivener (and I  
	am currently hunting for free apps that function similarly, explicitly for the purpose of searching my written  
	work against my sources through one program). 
	
 	Were I to have created a workflow several years ago, it would have been entirely manual except for some search-  
	engine work. Now, the shift toward digital research and writing is quite strong, but I am still holding onto  
	the manual process of recording my research by hand. I leave research and writing to the digital realm, but the  
	intermediary work of documenting and workshopping remain manual.
