# Seminar Notes: 22 January 2013 

Note: since the wifi was not functioning during our last meeting, some aspects of last week's lesson plan have been duplicated here.

## For Your Amusement

After responding to the Workflow prompt, I thought you'd find these two posts of interest (amusing, even):

## Why Teach Project Modelling, Prototyping, and Planning? 

Before we begin today, I want to make a quick set of remarks, which we can unpack throughout the semester. These remarks are an attempt to explain why we are taking time (early in the semester) to model and plan your various projects.    

The first is that project planning (when done persuasively) is largely about assessing and better understanding the specificity of the stuff we use and the conditions in which we use it. It also directly addresses what Matthew Kirschenbaum calls a [medial ideology](http://books.google.ca/books?id=CT0oPmcrciAC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA36#v=onepage&q&f=false), which substitutes popular representations of media for more comprehensive treatments of a technology's material particulars. 

The second is that project planning is also about equity, fairness, and scholarly responsibility. From my perspective (take it or leave it), if you are a humanities practitioner interested in working with technologies, then you should know more about how technologies function. Otherwise, you risk promoting service paradigms, where you have project ideas and other people execute them. This claim does not imply that you need to become a computer scientist or the like. But it does suggest that you should understand the layered social conditions (including power dynamics, labour, code bases, and resources) that enable a project's development, or that building in digital humanities (see [Stephen Ramsay's "On Building"](http://stephenramsay.us/text/2011/01/11/on-building.html)) involves many roles, which tend to be interdependent.  

And finally, a list: persuasive project models are: 

1. Transferable, duplicable, and conducive to implementation elsewhere (meaning they force you to consider your build's relevance to other groups, institutions, and settings, not to mention its warrants or working assumptions), 
2. Cognizant of how knowing informs doing, or theory informs practice, 
3. Iterative in their development, as well as flexible, scaleable, and friendly to revision and repurposing, 
4. Speculative or conjectural in character (meaning they predict and anticipate as much as they represent), and 
5. Self-reflexive and honest about uncertainty (including very real possibilities for conflicting outcomes, ambivalent data, and unanticipated exclusions) (see [Knigge and Cope, "Grounded Visualization"](http://www.envplan.com.ezproxy.library.uvic.ca/epa/fulltext/a38/a37327.pdf)).  

## *Relational Aesthetics* and Example Projects 

As we discuss the trajectories of our literary exhibit, let's be sure to refer to particulars from the following projects (to which I pointed last week): 

* [*The Deena Larsen Collection*](http://mith.umd.edu/larsen/)
* [*Europeana*](http://www.europeana.eu/portal/)
* [*Out of the Trenches*](http://www.canadiana.ca/en/pcdhn-lod)
* [*The Walt Whitman Archive*](http://www.whitmanarchive.org/)
* [*The Knotted Line*](http://knottedline.com/)
* [*Queer Zine Archive Project*](http://www.qzap.org/v5/index.php)
* [“I am It, and It is I”: Lovecraft in Providence](http://lovecraft.scholarslab.org/neatline-exhibits/show/lovecraft-in-providence/fullscreen) 

What about these projects interests you, and how might we transfer that interest to our 507 project? 

Also and elsewhere: how did you respond to Bourriaud's *Relational Aesthetics*? What did you make of art as a "bundle of relations with the world," or of form as the invention of "possible encounters," or of models as devices for artistic production, or of gallery visitors helping define an exhibition's structure? 

In short, how do we (or should we) occupy an exhibit? 

(Of note, for time's sake, I'm skipping my scheduled lecture on "Conjecture and the Speculative Humanities.") 

## Presentations 

Let's take roughly two minutes per person (about thirty minutes total) to share ideas for how to proceed with the exhibit. Please anchor your presentations in what you added to the [draft prospectus](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/blob/master/English507/ThoughtPiece/prospectus.md).  

For about thirty minutes, we will then workshop the presentations as a group, meaning we'll hold questions and comments until after all presentations are finished. The ultimate goal here is to gradually transition from the presentations into a working model for (or sketch of) the literary exhibit. We will then share that model with the other seminar (via GitHub).

## Workshop Notes

Based on your presentations, we should (at a minimum) articulate core teams (of no more than four people) that will make the exhibit happen. Of course, a team may collaborate on multiple projects or facets of the exhibit itself. That is, "team" does not imply "one project." Rather, teams will form around shared interests and methods.   

Notes from the workshop: 

Coming soon.

Core teams and team members: 

Coming soon. 

## Planning Your Team's Contributions to the Exhibit

Now let's break up into your newly formed teams for about fifteen to twenty minutes. Each team should then pull this file (SeminarNotes/012213notes.md) from GitHub and answer the following questions *in the doc itself*, thereby creating a new version of the doc (which you'll later push to our GitHub repo): 

* Briefly name and describe your team's project(s). The descriptions should be very brief, no longer than a sentence or two.  

* Will your team be publishing content on the web? If so, then briefly describe the content and (where possible) the tools that may be involved.  

* Will your team require space in the physical exhibit? If so, then briefly describe how you expect to use the space. 

* What's the anticipated lifespan of your team's project(s)? For instance, will content be mounted for the entirety of the exhibit (May through August)? Only a part of it? Before it? Before and after it? Online only? Online and offline? Offline only? 

* In terms of output, take what you hope to achieve this semester and reduce it by 50%. Now write down those reduced achievements here: 

* Identify *the* major concern you have right now (only one, please): 

## Sketching the Model 

For about thirty to forty minutes, let's meet as a group and plan the general infrastructure of the exhibit. In so doing, we should produce a working diagram of the space (on paper) and answer these questions: 

* What is our proposed layout for the physical space? What should go where? 

* What will we be publishing online, where will it be expressed, how will it be composed, and where will it be stored? 

* In the case of multiple digital projects, how will we wrangle them? Should references to them be in one space (e.g., an online index)? 

## Adding Content to Our GitHub Repo (Option 1: No Client) 

If you visit our repo in GitHub, then you can commit files directly to a given directory (assuming I've added you to the MLab org). Just press the "plus" icon to the right of the file path. Here's a still of the interface: 

![Image of GitHub](https://raw.github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/master/English507/SeminarNotes/github.png) 

There, you can also add and switch branches, using the button on the far left, just above the file path. Here's a still:

Branching is the creation of new copies of a repository, without changing the source branch or trunk. It is helpful when authors or developers want to develop an idea, patch, or feature without altering the existing state of a repository (or, if you prefer, a text). It's somewhat like writing with multiple identities, because you will often switch from, say, "branch a" to "master." 

Both of these options (i.e., buttons for branching and committing files) mean you can basically edit content within the GitHub interface as well as copy and paste content (e.g., from a text editor) into a repo. This approach is handy if you want to avoid clients or your operating system does not accommodate a client. 

The problem with this approach is you're not required to clone a repo to your local drive. Having the repo on your local drive affords convenient on- and offline reference, and it speeds up your writing and editing processes (e.g., you can push commits in bulk). It's also difficult to add a new subdirectory/folder when using the GitHub interface.  

For now, tho, please visit the [Workflow](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/tree/master/English507/Workflow) subdirectory and commit your workflow prompt from last week. The easiest way to do this is by copying all content from your .md file into the blank space generated by the GitHub interface. You might want to select the "soft wrap" option on the far right. That way, you can easily see all your content.  

Remember: the naming convention is "yourlastnameAssignment.md" (e.g., "sayersWorkflow.md"). Thanks! 

Before you commit the file, please make sure you are in the "master" branch and then provide a commit summary (e.g., "First Commit of sayersWorkflow.md"). Usually, first commits don't demand an extended description, but in the future you might want to use the description field to explain what exactly in the file you revised (e.g., changed all occurences of "digital labor" to "digital labour").      

## Adding Content to Our GitHub Repo (Option 2: Client) 

First, make sure you've got a GitHub client installed. It should also be hooked into your GitHub account. 

Now, in your browser, please visit [https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses). 

Next, click "code" in the top left, and then "clone in Mac" or "clone in Windows." Doing so should open your GitHub client, which will then ask you where you'd like to stash your Long Now repo (on your computer). I recommend putting it on your desktop. That way, you don't have to go digging into your computer's file structure to find it.   

The perks of this "cloning" approach include: lightweight transfer of data/files, ability to edit locally (without being on the web), and access to the repo by a distributed base of people. 

Once you have the repo on your computer, use your client to start a new branch. Use the client's GUI to simply add a branch to your "master" branch, label it with your last name (see the existing "sayers" branch), and then be sure to "switch" to that branch (if your client does not do so automatically). If you don't switch to this branch, then your changes will be pushed to the "master" branch (thus changing the base repository).  

Once you've switched to your new branch, commit at least one file to it, namely the version of the prospectus you recently produced in response to the [thought piece prompt](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/blob/master/English507/ThoughtPiece/thoughtPiecePrompt.md).

The easiest way to do this is to simply drag and drop your prospectus.md file into the [ThoughtPiece folder](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/tree/master/English507/ThoughtPiece) inside the repo on your computer. The client will notice you've made changes to the repo and "stage" them. 

Now visit your client and commit that staged change (which is really a snapshot of your .md file) to your particular branch (not the "master" branch). 

In the commit summary, you might want to write something like "First commit of prospectus.md to the [yourname] branch." Again, since this is your first commit, the extended description is not really essential. 

When you are ready, press "commit" and then "sync branch" (or just "sync"). If you wish, then you can visit  [https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses) to see your file in the "Workflow" subdirectory. Neat! 

## Committing Your Notes from Today

If, during the planning workshop earlier today, you were the person providing your team's answers to the questions above (via revisions to 012213notes.md), then please also commit that file to your branch of the repo. That way, we have documentation of each team's response. Let me know what questions you have here.  

Throughout the semester, I encourage you to contribute materials to the repo (e.g., notes from the seminar, content and code you are iteratively producing, and screen grabs of work in progress). Doing so will make your life much easier at the semester's end, when you submit your portfolio.    

## Next Week + The Needs Assessment and Outcomes Statement 

Here's [the prompt](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/blob/master/English507/NeedsAssessment/needsAssessmentPrompt.md). Please submit it to the master branch of English507/NeedAssessment before next week's meeting. 

Before that meeting, please also read McCarty, [“Knowing . . . : Modeling in Literary Studies”](http://nora.lis.uiuc.edu:3030/companion/view?docId=blackwell/9781405148641/9781405148641.xml&chunk.id=ss1-6-2&toc.id=0&brand=9781405148641_brand).

During next week's meeting, your team should also report on your work thus far. We'll keep the reports to approximately two minutes each, and they should be based on the Needs Assessment and Outcomes Statement. Thanks!
