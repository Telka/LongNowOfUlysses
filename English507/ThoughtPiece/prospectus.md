# Prospectus for “The Long Now of Ulysses”

Co-curated by Jentery Sayers, Stephen Ross, and English 507 (Spring 2013)

Author: Stephen Ross 

## Rationale

“The Long Now of Ulysses” takes the modernist fascination with time and space as its cornerstone, using James Joyce’s modernist masterpiece Ulysses as a springboard for presentation of a rich context of historical, cultural, and aesthetic materials in a range of media. It will introduce visitors to the broad contexts of modernism even as it brings to light both the everyday content and the avant-garde stylistic dimensions of the novel. The exhibit takes Ulysses as its starting point for several reasons: we have it and are concluding the first-ever publication of it online, it’s perhaps the sine qua non of high modernist literary production (barring only The Waste Land), and it was at the very center of a dizzyingly productive time and place -- Paris in the 1910s and 1920s -- and formed part of the context for, and was contextualised by, virtually every significant aspect of modernist cultural production. As such, it is not simply an instance of Anglo-American modernism, but perhaps its key metonym: the part that can stand for the whole, directing us out from its centrality to the rich context in which it emerged and which it in turn helped shape. In this respect, and as the ongoing fascination with modernist aesthetics demonstrates (e.g., the popularity of Mad Men, the recent worldwide tour of the Vorticist exhibit), we remain firmly in the long now of Ulysses even today. This exhibit will extend this long now across media, times, and places to suggest ways in which we might still treat Ulysses as a springboard into the cultures of modernity and even postmodernity. 

## Curation

The exhibit will be co-curated by Drs. Jentery Sayers and Ross, who will oversee the creative and collaborative contributions of the graduate students in Dr. Sayers' English 507 course (“Introduction to Digital Humanities”). The students will be responsible for developing the exhibit methodologies, including some use of "intelligent" environments and overcoming technological challenges; but, given the complex interplay of form and content in a literary exhibit, their role will not be reduced to that of service personnel. Along with the faculty and students from Dr. Ross' graduate seminar on modernism, they will also be responsible for the content of the exhibit, and will partially provide content expertise, including selecting the materials to be displayed. 

## Organization

The exhibit is organized into seventeen panels corresponding to the seventeen display cabinet sections arranged around the perimeter of the exhibit space, and in the six display cabinet sections located in the centre of the space. Each of the perimeter panels corresponds with an hour in the novel, whose episodes occur in approximately one-hour increments. The first panel will do double duty, displaying the hour of 8:00 am which is narrated twice in episodes 1 and 4 (first from Stephen Dedalus’s perspective and then from Leopold Bloom’s). The remaining panels will each correspond to a different hour and episode of the novel, making the exhibit room as a whole a spatial representation of the long day of Ulysses. 

## Perimeter Panels 

Each of the perimeter panels will be arranged around a large blow-up of twenty-two lines from a page in the novel. The pages have been chosen by applying an algorithm to the 1922 first edition of the novel as follows: given that the novel is set on June 16, 1904 and was published in 1922, we have taken 6, 16, and 22 as significant numbers. Starting with the first page of each episode, we counted six pages in and sixteen lines down from the top of the page to begin the excerpts we’ll blow up, and then excerpted 22 lines of text for the poster. This approach means that each panel is constituted by a given text whose significance is the product of a quasi-random process, just as modernist works of art increasingly turned to the everyday random experience of the city and rapid-fire technologies for their subject matter. Just as life itself began to feel as though it was blurring for many of the modernists in the first half of the twentieth century, so their works reflected an increased pace in which what Virginia Woolf called “moments of being” were more and more often accidental -- and accidents came to seem more and more significant of a higher order hidden behind superficial chaos. Our method of selecting the passages to blow up for the exhibit mimics this experience, treating Ulysses itself as an apparently chaotic welter from which order and significance can be extracted even when -- perhaps especially when -- the particular encounter is itself randomized. 

The blown-up text is only a springboard, an anchor, for each panel, though, and the exhibit places a premium upon moving beyond the textual alone in its displays. As the attached layout indicates, each panel will feature contextual materials that call out from the posterized excerpts: 

1. using a quotation from later in the book and/or a later work that evokes it, we will provide historical context for the passage, the novel, and modernism more broadly. Format: text and/or reproduced photographs or images. 
2. we will link the passage to a character in the novel, his or her historical basis, and the broader network of modernist cultural production in which they participated (and which participated in the production of Ulysses by proxy)
3. a visual art work that corresponds or evokes/is evoked by the passage will be hung proximate to the blown-up excerpt from the novel; these works will be selected primarily from the UVAC for their aesthetic correspondence and/or their implication in the network of cultural production that circulated around Joyce and his Ulysses. The Gisèle Freund photographs of Paris in the 1920s and 1930s will be of particular interest here, as will the UVAC's Klimt silkscreen and other materials in that vein (all depending upon availability and permission).  
4. an object or artifact that has been reproduced in 3D; these objects will be selected based upon their appearance in the novel, their contextual importance, and their interest factor as historical objects. We will model the objects from existing digital models/scans or scan objects from museum collections to which we have been given access (including UVAC) for this purpose. The objects will be printed on a MakerBot 3D printer (housed in the Maker Lab at UVic) in a resinous material, meaning that they can be freely handled by visitors to the exhibit without fear of damage or loss (should either occur, we will simply print replacements).  
5. sounds/music that correspond to the contexts will be available for playback. These will include historical recordings of soundscapes from the early twentieth century as well as songs, music, voices, readings, and machines. 
6. other texts that are evoked by/evoke the blown-up passage will themselves be presented in smaller blow-up excerpts and, where possible, in the original or rare editions held by Special Collections (in the locked display cases). At a minimum these will include rare editions of Ulysses, but also works by Wyndham Lewis, T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, John Betjeman, Herbert Read, Amelia Laracuen, letters, diaries, advertisements, newspaper pages (we have the 1904 Freeman, e.g.), etc.  

## Center Cabinets

The six cabinets located in the center of the space are organized according to the principle of unanticipated afterlives. They will feature works in which artists and critics have taken up Ulysses and its contexts in ways Joyce could not have anticipated: digital manifestations, cinematic renderings, live performances, architectural designs, artistic appropriations, inventive maps, music, etc. 

## Networked Ulysses

A part of the exhibit will interact with the fact that encyclopedic novels like Ulysses are, in a sense, themselves literary exhibits that compile in the space of a novel symbolic representations of artifacts taken from a variety of sources. Based on Bourriaud's contention that "the work of every artist is a bundle of relations to the world," the exhibit will explore the artist's connection to his contemporary social world. The process of opening up this side of the "bundle" will enable readings of the division of labour in the literary field in general, and with respect to Ulysses in particular, that differ markedly from descriptions of the novel as the work of a single creative genius. This approach is rooted in the idea that even though the artist is, in de Certeau's phrase, a "tenant of culture," he is not the only resident there. Hence the aim of this part of the exhibit is to arrive at a display that de-centres the authority of the authorial figure and highlights the role of Joyce's resources. The goal is to let visitors explore the connections of the Ulysses network in order to arrive at an understanding of the relational, networked character of novelistic production. In fact, the exhibit will treat Ulysses as a networked novel and try to read it through the current metaphors of network culture/social media/collaboration. 
The idea of Ulysses as a networked novel makes sense in (at least) two respects: first, regarding the *information* Joyce solicited from correspondents, archives, libraries, etc. Secondly, regarding the *actants* involved in the Ulysses network. 
* Using online documents/online files (e.g., if available, from the National Library of Ireland Online Archive) that pertain to pertinent sections of Ulysses, the exhibit will illustrate the novel's networked character by linking parts of text to "origins" (postcards, letters, notebook entries, archival research, etc.) and represent the different contributions along the lines of a Wiki workflow. 
* Using Google Maps to map the connections between actants in the Ulysses network (contributors, correspondents, editors, libraries, etc.) across Europe, the exhibit will present either an interactive display (granting visitors a degree of agency in manipulating the maps) or prints of informative maps, including pertinent statistics (distance between actants; time and space a piece of information traveled before inclusion in the manuscript, etc.). Finally, in analogy to current social media, the actants of the Ulysses network will be grouped together in a list of "friends," with links and interconnections displayed between them.
