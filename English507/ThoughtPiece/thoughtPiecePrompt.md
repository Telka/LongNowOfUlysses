# THOUGHT PIECE 

For our next meeting, we'll start organizing our approach to the literary exhibit, which we discussed during our first two meetings (including a visit to the proposed physical space). However, in order to begin our approach, I need to hear from each of you about your particular interests in exhibit-building (in particular) and digital humanities (at large). In a nutshell: how would you like to contribute to the exhibit, and what would you like to contribute? Ideally, you'll use some aspects of *Relational Aesthetics"* as well as the sample exhibits (listed below) for ideas.  

Instead of having you write response, I'm asking you to revise the [current prospectus for the Long Now of *Uylsses* exhibit](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/blob/master/English507/ThoughtPiece/prospectus.md). The details are below. You'll not only be revising existing content in the prospectus but also adding a section, which more or less explains your working idea (hence "thought piece") and what you want to contribute. 

This contribution may assume a variety of forms, from a particular aspect of the exhibit's physical design, mode of outreach/engagement, or expression of digital/analog content to an online component of its materials and narrative, a plan for mobilizing it elsewhere, or a way of digitizing, encoding, or fabricating its materials. (Note how none of these requires knowledge of *Ulysses*.) I encourage you to draw upon your own interests and investments while also pursuing something you wish to learn more about (i.e., something that's relatively new to you). I also encourage you to develop your idea in small groups (of two to four people). Again, more details below.

## SAMPLE PROJECTS 

Please briefly review the following exhibits, collections, and archives, each broadly understood: 

* [*The Deena Larsen Collection*](http://mith.umd.edu/larsen/)
* [*Europeana*](http://www.europeana.eu/portal/)
* [*Out of the Trenches*](http://www.canadiana.ca/en/pcdhn-lod)
* [*The Walt Whitman Archive*](http://www.whitmanarchive.org/)
* [*The Knotted Line*](http://knottedline.com/)
* [*Queer Zine Archive Project*](http://www.qzap.org/v5/index.php), and 
* [“I am It, and It is I”: Lovecraft in Providence](http://lovecraft.scholarslab.org/neatline-exhibits/show/lovecraft-in-providence/fullscreen). 

As you review them, keep our proposed exhibit in mind. What about these projects appeals to you? What does not? How are cultural materials exhibited or displayed, and to what effects on engagement and interpretation? Given our emphasis on the correspondences between on- and offline interactions, what can we learn from these projects (especially since we are only examining their web-based components)?

More broadly, in our current moment (as people studying English at UVic in 2013), how do you think literature should function in an exhibit, which is at once analog and digital? What is a "literary exhibit," after all? How should it be variously occupied? What new forms of communication, interpretation, and critical theory might inform the display of and interaction with literature and literary history? And how do we think long-term about these kinds of projects, at least in terms of how other people (scholars included) can pick up what we make and run with it? 

## LEARNING OUTCOMES

For you to:

* Articulate how you will contribute to our literary exhibit and what you will contribute, 
* Share your idea with the balance of the class (on Tuesday, January 22nd), 
* Develop experience in versioning the work you contribute to projects (e.g., via Git and GitHub), and 
* Start determining how and with whom you will collaborate in this seminar.  

## PRESENTATION

During seminar on January 22nd, you will be asked to present your response to this prompt, with an emphasis on the section you added. Groups who plan to collaborate will be lumped together, with each member still presenting (in sequential order by last name or the like). 

The presentations should be between one and two minutes. No need to bring slides or other materials. All you need to do is talk to us.  

Based on these presentations, during seminar we will begin planning our approach to the exhibit. 

## WHAT YOU SHOULD INCLUDE IN YOUR RESPONSE

Your response should actually be a revision of the [current prospectus for the Long Now of *Uylsses* exhibit](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/blob/master/English507/ThoughtPiece/prospectus.md), pushed to and synced with your own "branch" of our Long Now repo on GitHub. 

Please name the branch "yourlastname". (We did this during seminar on Tuesday the 15th.) 

At a minimum, the response should involve you: 

1. Revising some the existing content in the prospectus (how many revisions, and how significant they are, is up to you); and

2. Adding your own section (e.g., "Outreach," "Online Component," or "Mobilization Plan") at the bottom of the prospectus. (just after the "Center Cabinets" section) 

This added section should more or less reflect what you want to do this semester (including what you want to learn) and what you ultimately want to contribute to the exhibit. Before, during, and after writing this section, I recommend meeting with other folks in this seminar as well as students in English 560 (taught by Stephen Ross). Collaborating with other people will make your work both easier (in some senses) and more interesting (in most every sense). And while you are welcome to agree upon a particular approach to or component of the exhibit, you should each write and add your own section to prospectus. (Obviously, language, theories, and practices may be shared across your writing.) 

As you revise the prospectus, below are some questions for you to consider. Please do not address or answer them all. Also, please don't feel obliged to revise every section. Commit to meaningful revisions.  

In the "Rationale" section: 

* Are the claims justified? 

* Should the exhibit be more about modernism or the long now? Or can it manage to sustain both? 

* Should digital or transmedia methods be mentioned or highlighted? Or what would happen if the rationale was anchored not in the novel but rather in current modes of interpreting and engaging literature and literary history? 

In the "Curation" section: 

* What else might readers want to know about the curation process? What do you think curation involves that is not mentioned here? 

* Is this a fair representation of labour? Who is missing? Who else should be mentioned? Are roles (or anticipated roles) described accurately? 

* What do you make of the use of "content expertise" and "technological challenges"? Is there better language? 

* What are intelligent environments? 

In the "Organization" section: 

* How could this section be more precise? What information is missing (especially if you are not familiar with the novel)? 

* How else could the exhibit be organized? 

In the "Perimeter Panels" section: 

* Does the process appear random? What sorts of claims might justify this "computational" approach to making selections? 

* Based on your existing knowledge, does the method correspond well with modernist culture? Or do the justifications appear forced / hyperbolic? 

* Ignore the bit about "the attached layout." 

* What other contextual materials could be displayed? And how? 

* Does the list seem feasible? Can we actually manage all of it? How could it be refined, or what should / might be cut? 

*  Based on your own engagements with exhibits (e.g., in museums, libraries, or galleries), how might people's actual, embodied interactions with the exhibit be better considered? What seems like a good idea, and what doesn't?

In the "Center Cabinets" section: 

* When compared with "Perimeter Panels" section, this section is rather brief. How could it be more specific? 

* What do you think is meant by "unanticipated afterlives"? 

* What kinds of work (or actual work with which you are familiar) could be included in these cabinets? 

* Given that this part of this exhibit appears rather open to interpretation, how can we take advantage of this flexibility / opportunity?
