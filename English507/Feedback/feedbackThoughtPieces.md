# Feedback on Thought Pieces and First Presentations 

## Team Space and Time: AmH, AC, KT, TP

With each of you interested in maps, my first recommendation is to consider which platform you will use. Take a minute to review and even test your options, including Neatline, HyperCities, and Google Maps. In so doing, answer questions like: which platform is the most user-friendly? Which one will appeal to the broadest base of readers? Which allows me to best make the arguments I want to make (with the fewest modifications)? Which one allows me to easily separate data from expression? Which one allows me to talk about both time and space? Which affords the most persuasive narratives and visualizations? 

Of note, we can install Omeka on a UVic server, if you wish. As for HyperCities, determine whether you need to request an account (and what the wait might be, if so).    

I also recommend narrowing down the project to one or two maps, which could then be composed in rich and complex ways. If you commit to too many maps, then you risk producing rather superficial work. So, which of your ideas most warrants a map? 

As a reader and listener, I was most struck by three of the ideas in particular: presenting a history of Dublin through a range of changing historical maps, a map of *Ulysses*'s afterlives, and a map of historical correspondence (or the *Ulysses* network). Of those three, I actually think the third most warrants a map, especially if the network is invested in the physical addresses of actants (e.g., from where and to where people are sending letters). The first idea could just be a series of images, especially if you are concerned about distorting or warping historical maps (which will likely be composed differently, in various shapes and sizes) in 2D or 3D environments (e.g., stretching a 2D map onto Google's 3D Earth). The second idea is slippery when it comes to geospatial approaches, if only because it suggests (if I understand it correctly) that literary production and other such output can be mapped. For instance, when mapping afterlives (e.g., projects that have repurposed or republished *Ulysses*), do you map the location of the creators / authors? The press (if there's one)? Notable sales or areas of consumption? Libraries? Media coverage? For sure, these decisions can be made, but they are not easy ones.  

Where possible, I also encourage you to pursue an approach that accounts for both space and time. All three of these ideas could do this, if modelled and prototyped effectively. However, many geospatial projects not only tend to represent space homogeneously (think of Walter Benjamin's critique here). They also tend to ignore time or to enable its subsumption by geographical expression.     

Elsewhere, I'm open to hearing more about documenting interactions (between people and objects) in the gallery; however, there are a few things to consider: the lack of wifi and data in the space, human subjects regulations for gathering such data, and the general disinterest in things like QR codes. You might also think of virtual reality's rather sour history, which is now known for its gimmicks. Put differently: avoid gimmicks where you can. Privilege the novel interpretations and lines of inquiry that can emerge from new media, technologies, networks, and relationships.       

Relevant readings: I recommend Moretti's ["Conjectures on World Literature"](http://newleftreview.org/II/1/franco-moretti-conjectures-on-world-literature) and his other "distant reading" projects. On networks and their histories, this [conference website](http://networkarchaeology.wordpress.com/) is actually a great place to start. And generally speaking, there's plenty of material on both scaleable interpretation (across close and distant reading) and the material histories of networks. I'm happy to point you to that material, if you wish. I've now taught several classes on geospatial digital methods, and I've published on them.  

Before next week's seminar, you'll probably want to commit to **no more than three** (two might be best) of your working ideas, and you'll want to verify that the data's there (or can be there soon). This data would include information about the maps (including digital versions), historical correspondences (including physical addresses and the letters themselves), and the various "afterlives" (including relevant metadata on who did what, where and when).  

In fact, for these kinds of graphical expression projects, I really recommend making a spreadsheet, with columns acting as your various metadata elements (e.g., creator, longitude, latitude, text, and title). It's a great way to start a data model. 

I also suggest maintaining a log of everything you're doing, including what decisions you reach about not only your ideas but the platforms and media you are surveying. Routinely commit those logs to the master branch our GitHub repo, where there is now a folder called "Logs" in the English507 directory. These logs will become a really great reference, especially within the group and during portfolio time (at the semester's end). Trust me.  

Apologies if I misinterpreted anything, your thought pieces and presentations in particular. Let me know what I am missing or misunderstanding, and how I can help. Thanks! 

## Old and New Media Team: ZV, MR, ArH

While each of you is doing something rather distinct, I do believe there are some useful overlaps here. 

Before next week's seminar, I think it would be best if: 

* ZV had a list of which historical sounds (if only a sample) he was studying and/or reproducing; 
* MR had a few sample Max patches in mind (in order to start rendering them purpose-fit for the exhibit); and 
* ArH located / identified a stereoscopic camera and got the specs (to determine how, if it all, it could be replicated).  

Central to all of these inquiries is how, in short, we approach the senses through historical methods. If we cannot hear or be in the world like "they" did in 1904 Dublin, or if all history consists of exteriorities, then how do we examine, document, and express the historicity of mediated phenomena? What acts of re- or intermediation are involved? How should we (if at all) inhabit a material history of the senses? 

In terms of reading, you might appreciate selections of Ernst's new book, *Digital Memory and the Archive*. I also recommend Gitelman's work on sound and old media, as well as Sterne's *Audible Past*. ArH would likely find Crary's *Suspensions of Perception* relevant to his project, and there's plenty more reading to be had in these areas. Just ask if you want some recs. One of my exam fields was in this area, and it's the focus of my book project (a media archaeology of magnetic audio from today back to the 1850s).  

In terms of technology, documentation will be central to your projects. Please take video, audio, and/or photographs as often as possible. Logs will be key, too. Write down what you tried, what worked, and what didn't work. Commit those logs to our GitHub repo (in "English507/Logs"). Then you'll be able to reference them across the group and point to them in your final portfolio.  

Now, regarding specific technologies: 

* ArH: I imagine you'll be using some 3D stitching and modelling software, for which I can provide help. 
* MR: Max/MSP, correct? Do you have a copy? And I'm pretty sure you're set with audio software. But let me know if I'm mistaken.    
* ZV: Audacity? Pro Tools? Again, let me know what questions you have. (You should also consult with MR here.) It sounded like you already have some experience with this software, too. You may also want to determine how (if at all) your repo will be published online. Perusing existing ones, like [UbuWeb](http://www.ubu.com/sound) and SoundCloud, will help.  

I'm sure I'm missing something here, so just touch base with questions or concerns. Keeping a tight loop of communication is probably the easiest for all of us.  

## Team Text: MJ, DC, LD, AlH

For sure, your proposed projects are all quite different; nonetheless, each of them appears to be asking the question: what happens to *Ulysses* after the so-called "digital age"? Or how do we understand the materiality of the text after its digitization and online proliferation? 

Before next week's seminar, I recommend that: 

* MJ locates a few, inspiring "print+" projects that might inform her remediation of an episode of *Ulysses* (picking an episode might be a good idea, too); 
* DC communicates with me on acquiring the excerpts, developing an XML schema (in TEI, I assume?), and expressing XML as HTML online using XSLT; 
* LD refines her proposed use of timeline.js to determine how she will prompt people to contribute (I can also help with the data form and model, which will likely be expressed as a spreadsheet); and 
* AlH acquires a model for the cube and determines a way to translate TXT into binary (or her preferred format).  

All that said, the nice bit is that, MJ aside, each of you has a since of what technologies you are using and why. Correct? If not, then please let me know. I'm happy to help direct you, this week and early next included. And MJ: I encourage you to articulate your concept and technique first. Then we'll look for what platform or app is most relevant. Sound good? Also, for you print+ project, you might highlight ways of reading after the screen. In other words, it could be a project about material design, interaction, and attention as much as literary content. (In fact, that perspective might resolve some of your concerns about the content of *Ulysses*.) 

For relevant reading: 

* MJ, I can share my "designing literature" syllabus with you; also see Phillips's [*Humument*](http://humument.com/) and Sterling's ["Design Fiction"](http://shelovestofu.com/blog_uploads/2009/04/sterling-design-fiction.pdf), 
* DC, you might check out ["The Text Encoding Initiative and the Study of Literature"](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/companion/view?docId=blackwell/9781405148641/9781405148641.xml&chunk.id=ss1-6-6&toc.depth=1&toc.id=ss1-6-6&brand=9781405148641_brand), if you haven't, 
* LD, I recommend [Drucker on graphical display](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/1/000091/000091.html), and 
* AlH, you might find Zielinksi's [*Deep Time of the Media*](http://mediaarchaeologyofplace.org/downloads/readings/Zielinski_DeepTimeOfMedia_Chapters1and2.pdf) of interest, if you haven't already read it.  

Also, DC: as per your request, here's a great [Git cheat sheet](http://rogerdudler.github.com/git-guide/files/git_cheat_sheet.pdf). 

As you continue your work, please keep a log of what you're doing: the decisions you're making, what worked, what didn't, what's interesting at the moment. And then you can commit the logs to our GitHub directory (at "English507/Logs"). These logs will be handy for other people to reference; they will also be great resources at the semester's end. So document as much as you can (in a text editor or the like).    

## Outreach Team: NB, TD, JJ

I'm glad to see there's a group interested in outreach and extending the exhibit beyond its physical location on campus. After listening to your presentations and reading your thought pieces, ND, BTD, and JJ, my first recommendation is to refine the scope of your inquiry (when composing the needs assessment due before our next seminar meeting). Doing so will make your lives much easier for the balance of the semester.  

NB and JJ: it sounds like you are collaborating. Correct? For now, I'll refer to you under that assumption.  

Before Tuesday's meeting, I specifically recommend that: 

* NB and JJ dig into the particulars of their proposed game and determine what's feasible. I heard a lot of ideas floating in the presentation, and I think the key here is getting people where they live. In other words, apply gameful design (a term with which NB is familiar) to people's existing activities, with very little additional effort required on their part. Otherwise, you'll be asking people to commit to yet another space or app, and you might find them reluctant to do so. NB: you specifically recommended experimenting with Google's API. I think this is a great idea, but let me know if you and JJ need help with the particulars. I also like the idea of exploring time and everyday life (perhaps through geocaching) in this project. Whatever the ultimate decision, you'll also want to build usability testing into your timeline. (Again, see me for suggestions.) 

* TD determine how to focus learning and education in this context. Learning about *Ulysses*? Learning digital methods? Learning about *Ulysses* through digital methods? As I mentioned during seminar, the advantage of this learning-oriented project is you can build on the documentation that's emerging in our repo and translate it into something more public-facing, with a pedagogical inflection or tenor. In other words: how could we teach other people how to do what we are doing, and using what kinds of approaches? 

In terms of specific technologies: 

* NB and JJ, before Tuesday's seminar, I recommend identifying the specific app or platform you'll use for the game. Or, you might at least survey possibilities and identify the strengths / appeals of each. You might also articulate what your data will be and how it would be structured. (JJ: tomorrow's data modelling workshop will be helpful here.)   

* TD: it could be that your project only needs technology for dissemination purposes. For instance, what you circulate to larger audiences could be in PDF or the like (ideally, a format and mode that are accessible to a variety of audiences). If that's the case, then I recommend developing the materials first. We can then figure out how to store, index, and reference them online. However, this approach may not appeal to you. For instance, you might want to use a particular web-based platform to underscore how learning is changing and through what mechanisms. If that's the case, then let's talk. And generally speaking: I'd like to hear more about your interests in this particular project, which sounds great! I'm excited to learn more about it.  

As for relevant reading: 

* NB: you might point JJ to your emerging bib on gaming and gamification. Plenty of resources there. 

* TD: you might be interested in [DMLcentral](http://dmlcentral.net/), [IJLM](http://ijlm.net/journal), and [JITP](http://jitp.commons.gc.cuny.edu/). But let me know if I'm off-target here.  

As you continue this work, all of you should keep logs of what you're doing: what's working, what is not working, what you tested, what you tried, and what surprised you. You can then commit these logs periodically to the English507/Logs folder of our GitHub repo.  

Thanks again!
