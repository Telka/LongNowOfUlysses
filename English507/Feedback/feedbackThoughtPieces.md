# FEEDBACK ON THOUGHT PIECES AND FIRST PRESENTATIONS

## Team Space and Time (AmH, AC, KT, TP): 

With each of you interested in maps, my first recommendation is to consider which platform you will use. Take a minute to review and even test your options, including Neatline, HyperCities, and Google Maps. In so doing, answer questions like: which platform is the most user-friendly? Which one will appeal to the broadest base of readers? Which allows me to best make the arguments I want to make (with the fewest modifications)? Which one allows me to easily separate data from expression? Which one allows me to talk about both time and space? Which affords the most persuasive narratives and visualizations? 

Of note, we can install Omeka on a UVic server, if you wish. As for HyperCities, determine whether you need to request an account (and what the wait might be, if so).    

I also recommend narrowing down the project to one or two maps, which could then be composed in rich and complex ways. If you commit to too many maps, then you risk producing rather superficial work. So, which of your ideas most warrants a map? 

As a reader and listener, I was most struck by three of the ideas: presenting a history of Dublin through a range of changing historical maps, a map of *Ulysses* afterlives, and a map of historical correspondence (or the *Ulysses* network). Of those three, I actually think the third most warrants a map, especially if the network is invested in the physical addresses of actants (e.g., from where and to where people are sending letters). The first idea could just be a series of images, especially if you are concerned about distorting or warping historical maps (which will likely be composed differently, in various shapes and sizes) in 2D or 3D environments (e.g., stretching a 2D map onto Google's 3D Earth). The second idea is slippery when it comes to geospatial approaches, if only because it suggests (if I understand it correctly) that literary production and other such output can be mapped. For instance, when mapping afterlives (e.g., projects that have repurposed or republished *Ulysses*), do you map the location of the creators / authors? The press (if there's one)? Notable sales or areas of consumption? Libraries? Media coverage? For sure, these decisions can be made, but they are not easy ones.  

Where possible, I also encourage you to pursue an approach that accounts for both space and time. All three of these ideas could do this, if modelled and prototyped effectively. However, many geospatial projects not only tend to represent space homogeneously (think of Walter Benjamin's critique here). They also tend to ignore time or to enable its subsumption into geographical expression.     

Elsewhere, I'm open to hearing more about documenting interactions (between people and objects) in the gallery; however, there are a few things to consider: the lack of wifi and data in the space, human subjects regulations for gathering such data, and the general disinterest in things like QR codes. You might also think of virtual reality's rather sour history, which is now known for its gimmicks. Put differently: avoid gimmicks where you can.       

Relevant readings: I recommend Moretti's ["Conjectures on World Literature"](http://newleftreview.org/II/1/franco-moretti-conjectures-on-world-literature) and his other "distant reading" projects. On networks and their histories, this [conference website](http://networkarchaeology.wordpress.com/) is actually a great place to start. And generally speaking, there's plenty of material on scaleable interpretation (across close and distant reading) as well as the material histories of networks. I'm happy to point you to that material, if you wish. I've now taught several classes on geospatial digital methods, and I've published on them.  

Before next week's seminar, you'll probably want to commit to **no more than three** of your working ideas, and you'll want to verify that the data's there (or can be there soon). This data would include information about the maps (including digital versions), historical correspondence (including physical addresses and the letters themselves), and the various "afterlives" (including relevant metadata on who did what, where and when).  

In fact, I really recommend making a spreadsheet, with columns acting as your various metadata elements (e.g., creator, longitude, latitude, text, and title). It's a great way to start a data model. 

I also suggest maintaining a log of everything you're doing, including what decisions you reach about not only your ideas but the platforms and media you are surveying. Routinely commit those logs to our GitHub repo, where there is now a folder called "Logs" in the English507 directory. These logs will become a really great reference, especially within the group and during portfolio time (at the semester's end). Trust me.  

Apologies if I misinterpreted anything, your thought pieces and presentations in particular. Let me know what I am missing or misunderstanding, and how I can help. Thanks! 

## Old and New Media Team: ZV, MR, ArH

While each of you is doing something rather distinct, I do believe there are some useful overlaps here. 

Before next week's seminar, I think it would be best if: 

* ZV had a list of which historical sounds (if only a sample) he was studying and/or reproducing; 
* MR had a few sample Max patches in mind (in order to start rendering them purpose-fit for the exhibit); and 
* ArH located / identified a stereoscopic camera and got the specs (to determine how, if it all, it could be replicated).  

Central to all of these inquiries is how, in short, we approach the senses through historical methods. If we cannot hear or be in the world like "they" did in 1904 Dublin, or if all history consists of exteriorities, then how do we examine, document, and express the historicity of mediated phenomena? What acts of re- or intermediation are involved? How should we (if at all) inhabit a material history of the senses? 

In terms of reading, you might appreciate selections of Ernst's new book, *Digital Memory and the Archive*. I also recommend Kittler's work on sound, as well as Sterne's *Audible Past.* ArH would likely find Crary's *Suspensions of Perception* relevant to his project, and there's plenty more reading to be had in these areas. Just ask if you want some recs. One of my exam fields was in this area, and it's the focus of my book project (a media archaeology of magnetic audio from the 1850s to the present).  

In terms of technology, documentation will be central to your projects. Please take video, audio, and/or photographs as often as possible. Logs will be key, too. Write down what you tried, what worked, and what didn't work. Commit those logs to our GitHub repo (in "English507/Logs"). Then you'll be able to reference them across the group and point to them in your final portfolio.  

Now, regarding specific technologies: 

* ArH: I imagine you'll be using some 3D stitching and modelling software, for which I can provide help. 
* MR: Max/MSP, correct? Do you have a copy? And I'm pretty sure you're set with audio software. But let me know if I'm mistaken.    
* ZV: Audacity? Pro Tools? Again, let me know what questions you have. (You should also consult with MR here.) It sounded like you already have some experience with this software, too. You may also want to determine how (if at all) your repo will be published online. Perusing existing ones, like [UbuWeb](http://www.ubu.com/sound) and SoundCloud, will help.  

I'm sure I'm missing something here, so just touch base with questions or concerns. Keeping a tight loop of communication is probably the easiest for all of us.  

## Team Text: MJ, DC, LD, AlH

For sure, your proposed projects are all quite different; nonetheless, each of them appears to be asking the question: what happens to *Ulysses* after the so-called "digital age"? Or how do we understand the materiality of the text after its digitization and online proliferation? 

Before next week's seminar, I recommend that: 

* MJ locates a few, inspiring "print+" projects that might inform her remediation of an episode of *Ulysses* (picking an episode might be a good idea, too); 
* DC communicates with me on acquiring the excerpts, developing an XML schema (in TEI, I assume?), and expressing XML as HTML online using XSLT; 
* LD refines her proposed use of timeline.js to determine how she will prompt people to contribute (I can also help with the data form and model, which will likely be expressed as a Google spreadsheet); and 
* AlH acquires a model for the cube and determines a way to translate TXT into binary (or her preferred format).  

All that said, the nice bit is that, MJ aside, each of you has a since of what technologies you are using and why. Correct? If not, then please let me know. I'm happy to help direct you, this week and early next included. And MJ: I encourage you to articulate your concept and technique first. Then we'll look for what platform or app is most relevant. Sound good? 

For relevant reading: 

* MJ, I can share my "designing literature" syllabus with you; also see Phillips's [*Humument*](http://humument.com/) and Sterling's ["Design Fiction"](http://shelovestofu.com/blog_uploads/2009/04/sterling-design-fiction.pdf), 
* DC, you might check out ["The Text Encoding Initiative and the Study of Literature"](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/companion/view?docId=blackwell/9781405148641/9781405148641.xml&chunk.id=ss1-6-6&toc.depth=1&toc.id=ss1-6-6&brand=9781405148641_brand), if you haven't, 
* LD, I recommend [Drucker on graphical display](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/1/000091/000091.html), and 
* AlH, you might find Zielinksi's [*Deep Time of the Media*](http://mediaarchaeologyofplace.org/downloads/readings/Zielinski_DeepTimeOfMedia_Chapters1and2.pdf) of interest, if you haven't already read it.  

Also, DC: here's a great [Git cheat sheet](http://rogerdudler.github.com/git-guide/files/git_cheat_sheet.pdf). 

As you continue your work, please keep a log of what you're doing: the decisions you're making, what worked, what didn't, what's interesting at the moment. And then you can commit the logs to our GitHub directory (at "English507/Logs").
