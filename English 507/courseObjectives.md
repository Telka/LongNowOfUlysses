By the seminarâ€™s end, you will be expected to: 

+ Thoroughly document the iterative development of your learning using a distributed revision control system, 
+ Review the work of other digital humanities practitioners, provide feedback on that work, and evaluate it, 
+ Effectively model your own humanities data and articulate its curation plan, 
+ Persuasively present your work during a public roundtable consisting of at least three people, 
+ Collaboratively produce a public exhibit, which meaningfully engages and somehow intervenes in digital literary studies, and

+ Data curation, provenance, and interoperability, 
+ Data visualization and expression,
+ Text analysis,
+ Revision control and versioning,  
+ Usability and interface design,
