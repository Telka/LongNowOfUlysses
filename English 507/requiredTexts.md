# REQUIRED TEXTS, TOOLS, and PLATFORMS 	
There is no textbook for this seminar. All readings are available online and will be disseminated via links from the course website. Most readings are also open access. That said, you are not required to purchase any books or journal issues. Since most of the technologies we will be using are free and open source, you will also not be required to purchase any tools, apps, or platforms (even though I might recommend some that are not free but are worth purchasing for research purposes).
