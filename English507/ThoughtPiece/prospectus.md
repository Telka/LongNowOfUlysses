# Prospectus for “The Long Now of Ulysses”

Co-curated by Jentery Sayers, Stephen Ross, and English 507 (Spring 2013)

Author: Stephen Ross 

## Rationale

“The Long Now of Ulysses” applies the precepts of contemporary initiatives to encourage creativity and long-term thinking in today's accelerating culture to the modernist fascination with time and space. Taking its cue from projects such as those developed by[The Long Now Foundation](http://longnow.org/about/), the exhibit uses James Joyce’s modernist masterpiece Ulysses as a springboard for presentation of a rich context of historical, cultural, and aesthetic materials in a range of media. It will introduce visitors to the broad contexts of modernism even as it brings to light both the everyday content and the avant-garde stylistic dimensions of the novel. At the same time, it also questions how literature is changed, read, produced, and consumed in the so-called digital age. The exhibit takes Ulysses as its starting point for several reasons: we have it and are concluding the first-ever publication of it online, it’s perhaps the sine qua non of high modernist literary production (barring only The Waste Land), and it was at the very center of a dizzyingly productive time and place -- Paris in the 1910s and 1920s -- and formed part of the context for, and was contextualised by, virtually every significant aspect of modernist cultural production. As such, it is not simply an instance of modernism, but perhaps its key metonym: the part that can stand for the whole, directing us out from its centrality to the rich context in which it emerged and which it in turn helped shape. In this respect, and as the ongoing fascination with modernist aesthetics demonstrates (e.g., the popularity of Mad Men, the recent worldwide tour of the Vorticist exhibit), we remain firmly in the long now of Ulysses even today. This exhibit will extend this long now across media, times, and places to suggest ways in which we might still treat Ulysses as a springboard into the cultures of modernity and even postmodernity. 

## Curation

The exhibit will be co-curated by Drs. Jentery Sayers and Ross, who will oversee the creative and collaborative contributions of the graduate students in Dr. Sayers' English 507 course (“Introduction to Digital Humanities”)and Dr. Ross' English 560 course ("The Modernist Novel"). The 507 students will be responsible for developing the exhibit methodologies, including some use of intelligent environments (where computation will merge with the physical space and objects of the exhibit) and applying technological innovation. The faculty and 506 students will be responsible for the literary content of the exhibit, and will provide expertise on modernism and Joyce, which includes selecting the materials to be displayed. 

## Organization

The exhibit is organized into seventeen panels corresponding to the seventeen display cabinet sections arranged around the perimeter of the exhibit space, and in the six display cabinet sections located in the centre of the space. Each of the perimeter panels corresponds with a chapter, or episode, in the novel, which occur in approximately one-hour increments and combine to construct a narrative around a single day. The first panel will do double duty, displaying the hour of 8:00 am which is narrated twice in episodes 1 and 4 (first from Stephen Dedalus’s perspective and then from Leopold Bloom’s). The remaining panels will each correspond to a different hour and episode of the novel. 

## Perimeter Panels 

Each of the perimeter panels will be arranged around a large blow-up of twenty-two lines from a page in the novel. The pages have been chosen by applying an algorithm to the 1922 first edition of the novel as follows: given that the novel is set on June 16, 1904 and was published in 1922, we have taken 6, 16, and 22 as significant numbers. Starting with the first page of each episode, we counted six pages in and sixteen lines down from the top of the page to begin the excerpts we’ll blow up, and then excerpted 22 lines of text for the poster. This approach means that each panel is constituted by a given text whose significance is the product of a random process, just as modernist works of art increasingly turned to the everyday random experience of the city and rapid-fire technologies for their subject matter. Just as life itself began to feel as though it was blurring for many of the modernists in the first half of the twentieth century, so their works reflected an increased pace in which what Virginia Woolf called “moments of being” were more and more often accidental -- and accidents came to seem more and more significant of a higher order hidden behind superficial chaos. Our method of selecting the passages to blow up for the exhibit mimics this experience, treating Ulysses itself as an apparently chaotic welter from which order and significance can be extracted even when -- perhaps especially when -- the particular encounter is itself randomized. 

The blown-up text is only a springboard, an anchor, for each panel, though, and the exhibit places a premium upon moving beyond the textual alone in its displays. As the attached layout indicates, each panel will feature contextual materials that call out from the posterized excerpts: 

1. using a quotation from later in the book and/or a later work that evokes it, we will provide historical context for the passage, the novel, and modernism more broadly. Format: text and/or reproduced photographs or images. 
2. we will link the passage to a character in the novel, his or her historical basis, and the broader network of modernist cultural production in which they participated (and which participated in the production of Ulysses by proxy)
3. a visual art work that corresponds or evokes/is evoked by the passage will be hung proximate to the blown-up excerpt from the novel; these works will be selected primarily from the UVAC for their aesthetic correspondence and/or their implication in the network of cultural production that circulated around Joyce and his Ulysses. The Gisèle Freund photographs of Paris in the 1920s and 1930s will be of particular interest here, as will the UVAC's Klimt silkscreen and other materials in that vein (all depending upon availability and permission).  
4. an object or artifact that has been reproduced in 3D; these objects will be selected based upon their appearance in the novel, their contextual importance, and their interest factor as historical objects. We will model the objects from existing digital models/scans or scan objects from museum collections to which we have been given access (including UVAC) for this purpose. The objects will be printed on a MakerBot 3D printer (housed in the Maker Lab at UVic) in a resinous material, meaning that they can be freely handled by visitors to the exhibit without fear of damage or loss (should either occur, we will simply print replacements).  
5. sounds/music that correspond to the contexts will be available for playback. These will include historical recordings of soundscapes from the early twentieth century as well as songs, music, voices, readings, and machines. 
6. other texts that are evoked by/evoke the blown-up passage will themselves be presented in smaller blow-up excerpts and, where possible, in the original or rare editions held by Special Collections (in the locked display cases). At a minimum these will include rare editions of Ulysses, but also works by Wyndham Lewis, T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, John Betjeman, Herbert Read, Amelia Laracuen, letters, diaries, advertisements, newspaper pages (we have the 1904 Freeman, e.g.), etc.  

## Center Cabinets

The six cabinets located in the center of the space are organized according to the principle of unanticipated afterlives. They will feature works in which artists and critics have taken up Ulysses and its contexts in ways Joyce could not have anticipated: digital manifestations such as Robert Barry's electronic graphic-novel adaptation [Ulysses "Seen"](http://www.ulyssesseen.com/home.html), cinematic renderings, live performances, architectural designs, artistic appropriations, inventive maps like the digital [Leopold's Day Map](http://leopoldsday.com/), music, etc. 

## Analog Component

This section of the exhibit engages with the long now of the print novel, and imagines what forms future print versions of Ulysses might take. The artifact here questions how the moment of its digitization might affect print iterations of the novel. Following what innovative publisher [Visual Editions](http://www.visual-editions.com/) calls *visual writing*, the 'analog' object in this exhibit is a visually-inspired rendering of Ulysses that calls attention to the body and materiality of the novel and the physicality of the object, questioning what it means to read literature in a so-called digital age. Current examples of literary works that are re-imagining the embodiment of print include Jonathan Safran Foer's beautiful [Tree of Codes](http://www.visual-editions.com/our-books/tree-of-codes), Visual Editions's version of Laurence Sterne's [Tristram Shandy](http://www.visual-editions.com/our-books/tristram-shandy), and Anne's Carson's newest book, [Nox](http://jacket2.org/reviews/careful-assemblage). Based on the content provided by the students of 560 and Dr. Ross, an episode will be designed, printed, and displayed in the exhibit. While beautiful and imaginative editions of Ulysses, such as the magnificent [1935 George Macy edition](http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2012/06/19/matisse-ulysses-1935/), illustrated with etchings by Henri Matisse, are already available, the edition made for the exhibit will consider how new technology interacts with print to redefine the structural and narrative possibilities of the novel. "Make it new," Ezra Pound demanded of modernist writers. The analog component of the exhibit will consider how new technology is changing the physical and material possibilities of the print novel.
