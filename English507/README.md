This directory includes all the files (e.g., logs, code, markup, seminar notes, and components of the syllabus) for English 507, "Digital Literary Studies: History and Principles," at UVic (Spring 2013). Both the graduate students and the instructor (Jentery Sayers) in the seminar are co-curators of the "Long Now of *Ulysses*" exhibit, with an emphasis on the exhibit's digital, online, and transmedia components. This particular iteration of the seminar is in collaboration with English 560 (Spring 2013), taught by Stephen Ross.
