## 99 Ways to Version 

Here, I'll just cover just a few ways, if only to highlight how "versioning" has numerous valences across disciplines. At least 99 valences, of course.   

* Textual Studies: collating and comparing multiple witnesses (or documents) of a particular text, using [Juxta](http://juxtacommons.org/) for raw text or the [Versioning Machine](http://v-machine.org) for XML-encoded texts, for example (the idea here is often to rely upon computational methods to identify variance across witnesses) 

* Web Ethnography: capturing snapshots of the web for archiving and historical research, using the [Wayback Machine](http://web.archive.org/web/19981202001217/http://uvic.ca/), among others (the idea here is that web design and digital content can be examined materially, captured in time) 

* Writing Platforms: the "revision history" features built into platforms like [Google Drive](http://support.google.com/drive/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=190843), with "File > See Revision History", and Scalar, with its [history editor](http://scalar.usc.edu/nehvectors/nicest-kids/introduction.versions) (the idea here is that people rarely version their work manually or knowingly, so platforms should remember for them) 

* Versioning Software: the 0.0.0 format, where anything below 1.0.0 is an alpha or beta release (the first number represents significant functional states of the software, the second number represents minor features, and the third number represents bug fixes) 

## Version / Revision Control Systems

* Revision Control: 1) keeps track of output, 2) tracks changes, 3) tracks who makes changes, and 4) tracks justifications for changes

* produces a "tree" of a files in a repository (the repository comes not only with documents but also a change history of those documents and their versions; there's a general investment in documents with rich memory, or extensive documentation of and metadata for change) 

* RCS dev started in the 1970s (text files only); moved gradually from a centralized to a distributed system (e.g., SVN to Git, which we'll be using in this seminar) 

* Git was founded by [Linus Torvalds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) 

* An RCS is key to collaborations; they document the labor that's involved in turing this into that (see [Kirschenbaum](http://books.google.ca/books?id=CT0oPmcrciAC&dq) and [Fuller](http://books.google.ca/books?id=1FLIHNPucroC&dq)); they also allow teams to "revert" back to previous states and to control how content is produced across a group 

* some concepts typical to an RCS: 1) branching (creating new copies of a repository, without changing the source branch or trunk), 2) merging (integrate changes from a branch into another branch or main trunk), 3) differencing or diff'ing (compare changes in context), 4) staging (placing "snapshots" of changes to tracked files in an index), and 5) committing (recording and describing those snapshots, assigning it an email address and name) 

* Git is not GitHub; Git is the RCS, and GitHub is the social network / sharing mechanism for that RCS

## General Issues with Versioning 

* "a version always makes us aware of the distance between itself and its linked partners," [John Bryant](http://books.google.es/books/about/The_Fluid_Text.html?hl=es&id=1w4wpOdPbu4C)  

* how to identify meaningful change/difference between two files or witnesses? 

* writers do not always have agency over how versioning occurs (e.g., machines help us version complex texts and projects) 

* at the same time, versions are critical decisions (e.g., chunks of meaningful revisions); again, see see [Kirschenbaum](http://books.google.ca/books?id=CT0oPmcrciAC&dq)  

## Markdown 

Review this [worksheet](http://blog.lib.umn.edu/crosb002/leadership/Markdown_Cheat_Sheet.pdf), which I've also printed for you.  

Open your preferred text editor (e.g., TextWrangler or Notepad++), start a new file, and save it with the .md (rather than .txt) extension
