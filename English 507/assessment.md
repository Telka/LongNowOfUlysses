# ASSESSMENT 

Projects in this seminar are expected to be well-researched (making use of sources that are additional to any research bibliography that I may have provided), appropriately documented following the MLA bibliographic style, carefully proofread, and professionally presented. 

Letter grades will be assigned based on the following scale: 

90-100 = A+ 		

> Projects in this range are especially sophisticated and perceptive 
pieces of work that make an original contribution to scholarship. They could be published in a peer-reviewed scholarly journal.  

85-89 = A 		

> Projects in this range are perceptive and original, but may require 
substantial revision for publication in a scholarly journal. They would normally be accepted as conference presentations. 

80-84 = A- 		

> Projects in this range are adequate on the graduate level both with 
regard to the quality of content and writing and to research and presentation. 

77-79 = B+ 		

> Projects in this range have significant weaknesses in some areas, 
though still meet graduate standards.

73-76 = B		

>Projects in this range are marginally acceptable at graduate level.
