# Prospectus for “The Long Now of Ulysses”

Co-curated by Jentery Sayers, Stephen Ross, and English 507 (Spring 2013)

Author: Stephen Ross 

## Rationale

“The Long Now of Ulysses” takes the modernist fascination with time and space as its
cornerstone, using James Joyce’s modernist masterpiece Ulysses as a springboard for
presentation of a rich context of historical, cultural, and aesthetic materials in a
range of media. It will introduce visitors to the broad contexts of modernism
as it brings to light both the everyday content and the avant-garde stylistic
dimensions of the novel. The exhibit takes Ulysses as its starting point for several
reasons: we have access to its 1922 first edition, we are concluding the first-ever 
publication of it online and are in the midst of the [Modernist Versions Project's Year of Ulysses](http://web.uvic.ca/~mvp1922/)
dedicated to expanding the novel's readership and returning "this novel of the everyday back into everyday life," 
it’s perhaps the sine qua non of high modernist literary production 
(barring only The Waste Land), and it was at the very center of a dizzyingly productive time and place
-- Paris in the 1910s and 1920s -- and formed part of the context for, and was
contextualised by, virtually every significant aspect of modernist cultural
production. As such, it is not simply an instance of modernism, but perhaps its key
metonym: the part that can stand for the whole, directing us out from its centrality
to the rich context in which it emerged and which it in turn helped shape. In this
respect, and as the ongoing fascination with modernist aesthetics demonstrates, 
we remain firmly in the long now of Ulysses even today. This exhibit will
extend this long now across media, times, and places to suggest ways in which we
might still treat Ulysses as a springboard into the cultures of modernity and even
postmodernity. 

## Curation

The exhibit will be co-curated by Drs. Jentery Sayers and Stephen Ross, who will oversee the
creative and collaborative contributions of the graduate students in Dr. Sayers'
English 507 course (“Introduction to Digital Humanities”). The students will be responsible 
for developing the exhibit methodologies, including some use of
intelligent environments and presenting relevant content across media. The faculty will
be responsible for the content of the exhibit, and will provide content expertise,
including selecting the materials to be displayed. 

## Organization

The exhibit is organized into seventeen panels corresponding to the seventeen
display cabinet sections arranged around the perimeter of the exhibit space, and in
the six display cabinet sections located in the centre of the space. Each of the
perimeter panels corresponds with an hour in the novel, whose episodes occur in
approximately one-hour increments. The first panel will do double duty, displaying
the hour of 8:00 am which is narrated twice in episodes 1 and 4 (first from Stephen
Dedalus’s perspective and then from Leopold Bloom’s). The remaining panels will each
correspond to a different hour and episode of the novel. 

## Perimeter Panels 

Each of the perimeter panels will be arranged around a large blow-up of twenty-two
lines from a page in the novel. The pages have been chosen by applying an algorithm
to the 1922 first edition of the novel as follows: given that the novel is set on
June 16, 1904 and was published in 1922, we have taken 6, 16, and 22 as significant
numbers. Starting with the first page of each episode, we have counted six pages in and
sixteen lines down from the top of the page to begin the excerpts we’ll blow up, and
then excerpted 22 lines of text for the poster. This approach means that each panel
is constituted by a given text whose significance is the product of a random
process, just as modernist works of art increasingly turned to the everyday random
experience of the city and rapid-fire technologies for their subject matter. Just as
life itself began to feel as though it was blurring for many of the modernists in
the first half of the twentieth century, so their works reflected an increased pace
in which what Virginia Woolf called “moments of being” were more and more often
accidental -- and accidents came to seem more and more significant of a higher order
hidden behind superficial chaos. Our method of selecting the passages to blow up for
the exhibit mimics this experience, treating Ulysses itself as an apparently chaotic
welter from which order and significance can be extracted even when -- perhaps
especially when -- the particular encounter is itself randomized. 

The blown-up text will serve only as a springboard, an anchor, for each panel, however, and the
exhibit places a premium upon moving beyond the textual alone in its displays. As
the attached layout indicates, each panel will feature contextual materials that
call out from the posterized excerpts: 

1. using a quotation from later in the book and/or a later work that evokes it, we
will provide historical context for the passage, the novel, and modernism more
broadly. Format: text and/or reproduced photographs or images. 
2. we will link the passage to a character in the novel, his or her historical
basis, and the broader network of modernist cultural production in which they
participated (and which participated in the production of Ulysses by proxy)
3. a visual art work that corresponds or evokes/is evoked by the passage will be
hung proximate to the blown-up excerpt from the novel; these works will be selected
primarily from the UVAC for their aesthetic correspondence and/or their implication
in the network of cultural production that circulated around Joyce and his Ulysses.
[The Gisèle Freund photographs of Paris in the 1920s and 1930s](http://library.uvic.ca/dig/JamesJoyceinParis.html)
will be of particular interest here, as will the UVAC's Klimt silkscreen and other materials in that vein
(all depending upon availability and permission).  
4. an object or artifact that has been reproduced in 3D; these objects will be
selected based upon their appearance in the novel, their contextual importance, and
their interest factor as historical objects. We will model the objects from existing
digital models/scans or scan objects from museum collections to which we have been
given access (including UVAC) for this purpose. The objects will be printed on a
MakerBot 3D printer (housed in the Maker Lab at UVic) in a resinous material,
meaning that they can be freely handled by visitors to the exhibit without fear of
damage or loss (should either occur, we will simply print replacements).  
5. sounds/music that correspond to the contexts will be available for playback.
These will include historical recordings of soundscapes from the early twentieth
century as well as songs, music, voices, readings, and machines. 
6. other texts that are evoked by/evoke the blown-up passage will themselves be
presented in smaller blow-up excerpts and, where possible, in the original or rare
editions held by Special Collections (in the locked display cases). At a minimum
these will include rare editions of Ulysses, but also works by Wyndham Lewis, T. S.
Eliot, Ezra Pound, John Betjeman, Herbert Read, Amelia Laracuen, letters, diaries,
advertisements, newspaper pages (we have the 1904 [Freeman](http://www.irishnewsarchive.com/freemans-journal.php), which is referenced throughout the novel, e.g.), etc.  

## Center Cabinets

The six cabinets located in the center of the space are organized according to the
principle of unanticipated afterlives. They will feature works in which artists and
critics have taken up Ulysses and its contexts in ways Joyce could not have
anticipated: digital manifestations, cinematic renderings, live performances,
architectural designs, artistic appropriations, inventive maps, music, etc. 

## Multi-media Communications

As a multi-media exhibit dealing not only with a specific literary text, but with modernism across the arts, and the larger historical and cultural contexts in which both modernism (in general) and Ulysses (in particular) appeared, "The Long Now of Ulysses" strives to reach across scholarly disciplines; it is our goal that the exhibit be accessible and engaging to scholars, students, and community members alike beyond the fields of Joyce studies, high modernism, English literary studies -- perhaps even beyond the humanities in general. With its adoption of different styles and genres, wide-ranging cultural references (from Shakespeare to astronomical physics and thermodynamic entropy), and simultaneous avant-garde stylistic experimentation and rootedness in the everyday and popular culture, Ulysses provides particularly rich terrain for a literary exhibit to reach across increasingly divided disciplines and even appeal to extra-academic communities. By communicating across media to a non-specialist audience, we hope to combat the novel's esoteric reputation and bring this most everyday of novels back into the everyday. With special attention to the emergent media, technologies, art forms, and movements informing both the novel's narrative and composition, the exhibit incorporates a wide array of cultural artifacts (both original and reproduced) and interactive media dating from the beginning of the twentieth century to the present (the long now of modernity/ postmodernity).  

Ulysses is a novel in which the popular arts and their accompanying technologies are particularly prominent: its protagonist, Leopold Bloom, works as an advertising clerk, while his daughter studies photography; it features popular drinking songs and music hall numbers; most significant, perhaps, are its persistent references to the paradigm-shifting visual art forms (and their necessary accompanying technologies) of the early cinema of attractions and stereoscopic photography. We suggest that these allusions are anything but frivolous, that the new visual art forms ushered in by mechanical reproduction actually changed the way people in the late-nineteenthand early-twentieth centuries *saw* and experienced the world, that the technological developments of photography (in general) and cinema (in particular) are essential to the everyday phenomenologies of modernity, and just as significantly informed the aesthetic experiments of modernism. In other words, Joyce *sees* -- as do some of his characters -- as one whose vision has been structured, even radically and irrevocably altered, by the dramatic encounter with the stereoscopic and cinematographic image. The exhibit explores the complex relationships between the mechanically reproducible photographic/ cinematographic image and the novel, with the cultures of modernity at large, as well as with our own digital culture in its evolved forms in the following ways:  

1. by digitally projecting Thomas Edison's 1894 footage of Eugen Sandow ("Sandow the Strong Man"), frequently referenced in Ulysses, we hope to provide valuable context for the type of cinema available to Bloom and others living in the early-twentieth century. By combining Edison's Kinetoscope footage with digital means of video transfer and presentation, we also demonstrate how the medium has evolved, and how our own visual paradigms have evolved with it.  
2. by recreating an early version of the stereoscope we show how the advent of 3D photography structured a new kind of vision, creating the illusion of depth by using nearly identical two-dimensional images and offsetting the right eye from the left, or -- in Bloom's words, "Flat I see, then think distance, near, far, flat I see, east, back. Ah, see now! Falls back suddenly, frozen in stereoscope." We argue that stereoscopy, like cinema, contributed dramatically to paradigmatic shifts in modern phenomenology by structuring vision in previously unexperienced ways. While conceding that further technological innovations may hinder this, we suggest that by using a recreation of an early-twentieth century stereoscope, exhibit-goers might be able to experience vision as Bloom and others living in the early-twentieth century had. We also show through 3D-modelling how stereoscopy has evolved in our digital age.
