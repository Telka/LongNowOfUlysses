# WORKFLOW

Talking about a “workflow” (or a sequence of steps in the scholarly labor process) seems so banal, boring, and obvious. But, the thing is, how you routinely write and conduct research—and through what mechanisms—really matters, especially when you are frequently engaging digital materials. What’s more, we are arguably in a moment where all of us are still learning how to produce knowledge in rapidly changing environments. There is an abundance of options or apps (some free, some not; some helpful, some a waste of time), and they are all aimed at particular audiences, under certain assumptions about how content is (or should be) created, used, stored, and circulated. To be sure, even the software we use is ideological in character.

So, for a humanities take on a scholarly workflow (whatever that ultimately means), we’ll look to William J. Turkel’s [“A Workflow for Digital Research Using Off-the-Shelf Tools"](http://williamjturkel.net/how-to/).

Please read it carefully, and note that it consists of nine individual entries (e.g., “Make Local Copies of Everything” and “Measure and Refactor Constantly”), not just the index page labeled “how to.”

As you read, I recommend testing a few of the options Turkel recommends. Most of them are free and open-source, a few of them are addictive (or maybe that’s just me), and many of them are common in higher education (especially in the humanities).

If, when you are finished, you find that you are not interested in anything he suggests, then fine by me. This is not an exercise in bandwagon-hopping, digital humanities hipster-ism, or evangelizing for particular technologies. You are more than welcome to stick with what you are currently using and doing. All I ask is that you reflect on your decisions and spell them out.

## LEARNING OUTCOMES

For you to:

* Start (if you haven’t already) thinking deliberately about how you gather and compose media in digital environments,
* Articulate (if only in the ideal) what your everyday writing and research workflows might involve, and
* Gather a sense of how others in the field do work, and through what applications and techniques.

## WHAT YOU SHOULD INCLUDE IN YOUR RESPONSE

Length: approximately 250-500 words, text only, due by email to me before class on Tuesday the 15th (attachments are fine)

Also, if you bring your laptop to our meeting on the 15th, then I suggest bringing the file for this assignment. You'll be using it during one of our workshops, when we learn markdown and git. 

While I recommend covering all nine areas Turkel addresses, in writing please respond at least to the following:

* What web browser(s) will you be using, and how (if at all) are you customizing it/them? Why? (See Turkel, [“Going Digital"](http://williamjturkel.net/2011/03/15/going-digital/).)
* What’s your backup strategy? How frequently do you (or will you) backup your work? (See Turkel, [“Start with a Backup and Versioning Strategy”](http://williamjturkel.net/2011/02/22/backup-and-versioning/).)
* How will you routinely make local copies? How will you “clip” or save the ostensibly ephemeral web content you are engaging? (See Turkel, [“Make Local Copies of Everything"](http://williamjturkel.net/2011/03/07/make-local-copies/).)
* What apps will you be using for writing? What’s the purpose of each? (See Turkel, [“Write and Cluster Small Texts”](http://williamjturkel.net/2011/04/04/write-and-cluster/).)
* Generally speaking, what do you think these steps suggest (if only tacitly) about your research and writing processes? What are you delegating to a computer, and what do you insist on doing manually?

To help you along, I’ve created a short and [pretty terrible video](https://vimeo.com/34515157). It gives you a cursory sense of what, on a regular basis, I use for research and writing purposes. (Many things are of course missing.)

But again: during this seminar feel free to stick with what you feel is the best fit for your own style and habits. If nothing else, the point of this exercise is to give you a sense of what's out there for digital research and composition.
