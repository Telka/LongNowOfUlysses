# NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND OUTCOMES STATEMENT 

After both the [Thought Piece](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/blob/master/English507/ThoughtPiece/thoughtPiecePrompt.md) and the project development workshops we conducted during seminar on January 22nd, the next step in articulating your contribution to the Long Now of *Ulysses* exhibit is refining that contribution, namely through a needs assessment and outcomes statement, which ask you to anchor your project in some concrete particulars.  

## LEARNING OUTCOMES  

For you to: 

* Define the scope, risks, constraints, and benefits of your 507 project, 
* Situate your 507 project on a timeline, 
* List what materials you need to make your project happen by the semester's end, and 
* Describe what you think "success" will mean for your project.   

## WHAT YOU SHOULD INCLUDE IN YOUR RESPONSE 

Your response should be written in Markdown and submitted to the master branch of the [NeedsAssessment folder](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/tree/master/English507/NeedsAssessment) in our GitHub repo before seminar on January 29th.   

The response should: 

* Provide a polished project summary (~100 words) intended for educated, non-expert audiences, including people who may be attending Congress 2013.  

* Provide a concrete list of materials (e.g., data, technologies, and media) you need to make your project happen as well as a short list (or bib) of relevant texts and projects you plan to reference or peruse.   

* Define (in ~50 words) a reasonable scope for your project, including (where applicable) scope in terms of time, space, and resources. Most importantly, the scope should be aware of what your project cannot achieve in a single semester.  

* Define (in ~50 words) the risks and constraints of your project, including time and material constraints as well as what you are unsure of right now.  

* Explain (in ~50 words) how your project will ultimately benefit others and who, exactly, it will benefit.  

* List key deadlines you are setting for yourself and (where applicable) your team. What exactly are you going to do and by when? In so doing, you might want to review [the outline for the semester](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/blob/master/English507/schedule.md). Note especially when draft project / exhibit components are due. Also include time (at least a week) for surprises and hiccups.  

* List two (and only two) particular things for which you need the most support in order to make your project happen. These things can range from technical support (e.g., an instance of a platform installed somewhere) to a workshop (e.g., on a particular digital method) or a list of recommended readings.  

* Articulate two project outcomes, which (if met) will mean your project was successful. These outcomes should describe the project itself.  

* Finally, articulate two outcomes for your own learning that (if met) will also mean your project was successful. These outcomes should be about your own educational and professional investments. 

## TOO EARLY IN THE SEMESTER FOR THIS BIT? 

I realize we are still early in the semester and many aspects of this prompt ask you to think ahead (perhaps beyond what you can expect or know). That said, I anticipate changes, but I also want you to start thinking concretely about feasibility and implementation issues before you are too far along.  

If you have a question about how to proceed or respond to a specific component of this prompt, then feel free to email me or drop by my office / lab.
