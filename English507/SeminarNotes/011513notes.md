# Seminar Notes: 15 January 2013 (Note: the wifi was down in our building. We were not able to complete some aspects of this lesson plan, including all of the work with GitHub, which has been suspended until our next seminar, with the Thought Piece prompt revised accordingly.) 

## 99 Ways to Version 

Here, I'll cover just a few ways, if only to highlight how "versioning" has numerous valences across disciplines. At least 99 valences, of course.   

* Textual Studies: collating and comparing multiple witnesses (or documents) of a particular text; for example, using [Juxta](http://juxtacommons.org/) for raw text or the [Versioning Machine](http://v-machine.org) for XML-encoded texts (the idea here is to rely on computational methods to identify variance across witnesses) 

* Web Ethnography: capturing snapshots of the web for archival purposes and historical research; for example, using the [Wayback Machine](http://web.archive.org/web/19981202001217/http://uvic.ca/) (the idea here is that web design and digital content can be examined materially, captured in time for later reference and comparative analysis) 

* Writing Platforms: the "revision history" features built into platforms like [Google Drive](http://support.google.com/drive/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=190843), with "File > See Revision History;" and Scalar, with its [history editor](http://scalar.usc.edu/nehvectors/nicest-kids/introduction.versions) (the idea here is that people rarely version their work manually or knowingly, so platforms should/can remember for them) 

* Versioning Software: the 0.0.0 format, where anything below 1.0.0 is an alpha or beta release (the first number represents significant functional states of the software, the second number represents minor features, and the third number represents bug fixes) 

## Version / Revision Control Systems

* Revision Control System (RCS): 1) keeps track of output, 2) tracks changes, 3) tracks who makes changes, and 4) tracks justifications for changes

* An RCS facilitates a "tree" of files in a repository (the repository comes not only with documents but also a change history of those documents and their versions; there's a general investment in documents with rich memory, or extensive documentation of and metadata for change). 

* RCS dev started in the 1970s (text files only); it moved gradually from a centralized to a distributed system (e.g., [SVN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion) to [Git](http://learn.github.com/p/intro.html), which we'll be using in this seminar). 

* Git is a thing by [Linus Torvalds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds). 

* An RCS is key to collaborative writing and code dev; it documents the labor involved in turning this into that (see [Kirschenbaum](http://books.google.ca/books?id=CT0oPmcrciAC&dq) and [Fuller](http://books.google.ca/books?id=1FLIHNPucroC&dq)).

* An RCS also allows teams to "revert" back to previous states and to control how content is produced across a group. 

* Some concepts typical to an RCS: 1) branching (creating new copies of a repository, without changing the source branch or trunk), 2) merging (integrating changes from a branch into another branch or main trunk), 3) differencing or diff'ing (comparing changes in context), 4) staging (placing "snapshots" of changes to tracked files in an index for review), and 5) committing (recording and describing those snapshots, assigning them an email address, time, and name). 

* Important: Git is not GitHub; Git is the RCS, and GitHub is the social network / sharing mechanism for that RCS.

* Many people run Git from the command line; there are also Git clients, with [GUIs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface), for those who avoid the command line. 

## General, Humanities-Based Issues with Versioning 

* "a version always makes us aware of the distance between itself and its linked partners," [John Bryant](http://books.google.es/books/about/The_Fluid_Text.html?hl=es&id=1w4wpOdPbu4C)  

* How to identify meaningful change/difference between multiple files, stacks, or witnesses? In the last instance, what's the difference that actually matters? 

* How to point precisely to specific changes? Often, differencing tools only highlight general areas of change (e.g., a line, which can be quite long). 

* Writers do not always have agency over how versioning occurs (e.g., machines help us version complex texts and projects). So how to write with machines and distributed systems? What should writers and developers know about how machines see and save their work? 

* Versions are critical decisions (e.g., identified chunks or commits of meaningful revisions), not "innate" states. Again, see [Kirschenbaum](http://books.google.ca/books?id=CT0oPmcrciAC&dq).  

## Learning Markdown, Git, and GitHub: Getting Started 

First, do you have a GitHub account? If not, then please set one up at [https://github.com/](https://github.com/). 

Once you are registered, please let me know your account name, which does not need to reveal your actual name, btw. I will add you as a member of the [MLab Org](https://github.com/organizations/uvicmakerlab/), which administers our repository. 

Next, open your preferred text editor. Your computer comes with at least one default editor (e.g., TextEdit). I recommend [TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler) for Macs and [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) for Windows. Take a minute to download and install them, if you haven't already.  

Finally, you'll want a GitHub client. For this course, I'm going to recommend [GitHub for Mac](http://mac.github.com/) and [GitHub for Windows](http://windows.github.com/). They are both friendly to beginners, and they keep Git's more advanced/complex features on the margins, allowing you to stick to the basics.  

Once you have a GitHub account and client, as well as your text editor open and running, then we'll talk Markdown.  

## Markdown 

Review this [worksheet](http://blog.lib.umn.edu/crosb002/leadership/Markdown_Cheat_Sheet.pdf), which I've also printed for you.  

In short, Markdown (or .md) is a syntax for converting simple text into HTML. Among other things, it makes writing markup language easy and fast. So, for instance, \<h1> becomes #\.  

To begin writing in Markdown, copy and paste your response to the [Workflow prompt](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/blob/master/English507/Workflow/workflowPrompt.md) into your preferred text editor.  

Now save the file using this convention and extension: yourlastnameWorkflow.md (replace "yourlastname" with your last name). Note the use of [CamelCase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_caps) in the filename. The use of internal uppercase letters will allow us to avoid including spaces or unnecessary symbols in our filenames this semester. In particular, space can be a problem in digital projects. It is translated into %20 in URLs and the like. Yuck. Neither machine nor human eyes appreciate %20. 

We'll be using this naming convention all semester. So, for instance: sayersThoughtPiece.md, sayersNeedsAssessment.md, and so on. The use of your last name in the filename will also make it easier for you to quickly find, gather, and bundle all your contributions (especially when you are producing a portfolio toward the semester's end). 

Now that you've got a file with content in it, as well as a filename including your last name, the prompt name, and the .md extension, use the worksheet to translate your workflow response from plain text into Markdown. As you do, let me know what questions you have. We'll take a few minutes during the workshop to transform your writing into Markdown.  

## Git, GitHub, and a GitHub Client  

Now we're going to "push" your file to our Long Now repository on GitHub. 

First, make sure you've got a GitHub client installed. (See the "Learning Markdown, Git, and GitHub: Getting Started" section above.) It should also be hooked into your GitHub account. 

(If you'd rather not or cannot use a client (e.g., you're running OSX 10.6), then you can add and modify files direclty in GitHub. See me if you'd prefer this option.) 

Now, in your browser, please visit [https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses). 

Next, click "code" in the top left, and then "clone in Mac" or "clone in Windows." Doing so should open your GitHub client, which will then ask you where you'd like to stash your Long Now repo (on your computer). I recommend putting it on your desktop. That way, you don't have to go digging into your computer's file structure to find it.   

The perks of this "cloning" approach include: lightweight transfer of data/files, ability to edit locally (without being on the web), and accessibility of the repo to broad base of people. 

Once you have the repo on your computer, open it and find the "Workflow" subdirectory (inside "English507"). There, you should see two files: workflowPrompt.md and README.md. 

Go ahead and drag-and-drop your "yourlastnameWorkflow.md" file into the "Workflow" subdirectory. 

Now visit your GitHub client, which will notice that you changed something. Go ahead and commit that "staged" change (which is really a snapshot of your .md file). 

In the commit summary, you might want to write something like "First commit of my workflow response." Since this is your first commit, the extended description is not really essential. But feel free to describe your file there (including its content). The extended description is generally useful for describing changes to a file (e.g., changed all occurences of "digital labor" to "digital labour").    

When you are ready, press "commit" and then "sync branch" (or just "sync"). If you wish, then you can visit  [https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses) to see your file in the "Workflow" subdirectory. Neat! 

## Reviewing the Exhibit Prospectus

Now, to . . . ahem . . . "push" what we can manage with Git and GitHub in this course, we're going to try versioning the current [Prospectus for the Long Now of *Ulysses* exhibit](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/blob/master/English507/ThoughtPiece/prospectus.md).  

First, tho, we should read through it and discuss it as a group.  

What seems feasible? What's too blue-sky? What's clear, and what isn't? What appeals to you, and what possibilities or inquiries are missing? 

By the way, here's [more on the long now](http://longnow.org/essays/big-here-long-now/).

Next, we should discuss how to branch the prospectus and create multiple versions of it.  

## An Intro to Branching 

As mentioned above, branching is the creation of new copies of a repository, without changing the source branch or trunk. It is helpful when authors or developers want to develop an idea, patch, or feature without altering the existing state of a repository (or, if you prefer, a text). It's somewhat like writing with multiple identities, because you will often switch from, say, "branch a" to "master." 

You can create a new branch in GitHub (see me for details), or you can create one in your client. In the latter case, use the GUI to simply add a branch to your "master" branch, label it with your last name (see the existing "sayers" branch), and then be sure to "switch" to that branch (if your client does not do so automatically). If you don't switch to this branch, then your changes will be pushed to the "master" branch (thus changing the base repository).  

Once you've switched to your new branch, try making and pushing a simple edit to the [prospectus](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/blob/master/English507/ThoughtPiece/prospectus.md) for The Long Now of *Ulysses*. Then, in GitHub, switch across branches to note the differences.  

Let me know what questions you have. We'll be using branches all semester, and soon we'll talk about how to merge them (or aspects of them) back into the main trunk of our repository.  

## Stephen Ross's Visit 

![Stephen Ross](http://ring.uvic.ca/sites/default/files/images/ross.jpg)

Issues emerging before and during Stephen's visit: 

* What infrastructure can we establish to facilitate communications and sharing between English 507 and English 560? How can 507 communicate with 560 without adding more labour and requirements to a graduate student's plate? (Jentery will consider ways of integrating 560's work into this Long Now repo. It's important that output from each seminar is documented and accessible.) 

* How do we avoid content/form splits as well as idea/service paradigms (e.g., I'll build that for you) in digital literary studies? In what ways is content **not** king in literary studies? In what ways do objects on display in an exhibit **not** determine interpretations of the exhibit? At the same time, how should exhibits be constructed with content in mind? How can infrastructure and design mirror and even perform tropes and concepts from a novel like *Ulysses*? How can *Ulysses* and its various features be occupied? 

* We have **a lot** of things on the table. The exhibit appears brimming with possibilities, which are exciting. In the coming weeks, how do we refine them and build accordingly? During our next seminar meeting, we'll start articulating specifics. We'll also start modelling the exhibit itself, based on everyone's presentations.   

* How do we avoid making the exhibit an exhibit solely about *Ulysses*, intended solely for scholars of modernism, Joyce, or the novel itself? We should consider other "draws," which would appeal to an array of non-specialist audiences. Here, innovative modes of interaction, an engagement with the everyday, and curious approaches to outreach might be worth considering.  

* For people in 507 who have not read *Ulysses*, how do we mobilize that experience (of not knowing) in order to better understand our audiences who will inevitably be unfamiliar with the novel? This is not simply a question of appeal. It's a matter of making the exhibit relevant, content and design included. For instance, how could the exhibit spark non-specialist interest in the novel? 

* We should frame and approach 507 as a problem- and project-based seminar about the functions, aims, and manifestations of literary exhibits today. What should literary exhibits do in our current moment, and how could our literary exhibit transfer to other exhibits (perhaps about other novels and other literary topics)? This approach may help us avoid the cotent/form and ideas/service divides.  

* How is the exhibit a question of scale? For instance, how should we think of it within the context of the gallery? Of the campus? Of Victoria? Of the web? 

* We can't forget that one of the most interesting things about this project is the development of the project itself, hence the need for active and iterative documentation.  

## Review of Existing Projects

Before next week's meeting, please **briefly** review the following projects: [*The Deena Larsen Collection*](http://mith.umd.edu/larsen/), [*Europeana*](http://www.europeana.eu/portal/), [*Out of the Trenches*](http://www.canadiana.ca/en/pcdhn-lod), [*The Walt Whitman Archive*](http://www.whitmanarchive.org/), [*The Knotted Line*](http://knottedline.com/), [*Queer Zine Archive Project*](http://www.qzap.org/v5/index.php), and [“I am It, and It is I”: Lovecraft in Providence](http://lovecraft.scholarslab.org/neatline-exhibits/show/lovecraft-in-providence/fullscreen). 

As you review them, keep our proposed exhibit in mind. What about these projects appeals to you? What does not? How are cultural materials exhibited or displayed, and to what effects on engagement and interpretation? Given our emphasis on the correspondences between on- and offline interactions, what can we learn from these projects (especially since we are only examining their web-based components)?

More broadly, in our current moment (as people studying English at UVic in 2013), how do you think literature should function in an exhibit, which is at once analog and digital? What is a "literary exhibit," after all? How should it be variously occupied? What new forms of communication, interpretation, and critical theory might inform the display of and interaction with literature and literary history? And how do we think long-term about these kinds of projects, at least in terms of how other people (scholars included) can pick up what we make and run with it?   

## The Thought Piece

Here's [the prompt](https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/LongNowOfUlysses/blob/master/English507/ThoughtPiece/thoughtPiecePrompt.md). Let's review before you leave. Also, please run your ideas by me if you have any questions or concerns. Don't hesitate to ask. I'll be around this week and the next.
