I use Firefox but I have not really spent much time with plugins. I installed WorldCat, Internet Archive, Project Gutenberg, and will toy with them to see how they fit into my workflow. I use the Webster application pretty regularly so I don’t imagine I’ll use Merriam Webster built into a browser as it only takes me a second to open applications with Quicksilver.

Not using an RSS reader has been a point of guilt for me – and has been in my to do list in Things – for over a year. No longer. Google Reader is disgustingly easy and does nothing to help my shame at not doing this earlier.

I’ll give Zotero and Mendeley a try for a bit since, unlike endnote or Sente, they’re free. In my undergrad I had a strained relationship with the citation function in Word that ended with me doing everything by hand. When I bought my iPad I spent a lot of time considering Sente or Papers with the mobile markup applications. I’m not ready to invest the time or money into one of these yet so I keep an organized file library and keep to-read/markup PDFs in dropbox where they are accessed by my iPad using iAnnotate. When I consider a new PDF management system I look at devonthink as an option.

For backing up I’ve used Time Machine with a Time Capsule but became frustrated with the glitches of the 1st generation time capsule over wi-fi so I’ve gone to manually backing up. For audio or video work this means after every session, on an external drive with versions created manually. For writing I find myself backing up not nearly enough, maybe every couple of weeks and rarely with manual versioning. It’s time to return to automated backups for essential files. Whether this will be Time Machine or iCloud or another option is yet to be seen.

I do all my writing in Word using three documents: A scratch doc where I can throw blocks of text and develop them independently, leave them as notes for later, or save past versions of larger chunks of text. An outline doc that is versioned internally for major changes. Finally, then there is the actual writing doc where the main body of texts is located. Scrivener looks interesting and I may invest the time into experimenting with it as it consolidates my three-doc method.

In terms of local copying for smaller files like CFP’s or small quoted fragments I use Evernote, which also plays an important role in developing ideas in smaller forms before working on larger ideas in Word. For larger items such as articles I often create a PDF in word then store it in my library as I would a journal article or book.

I like the idea of using spiders to harvest but I don’t think that I do enough online research to warrant investing time in this. Bursting documents also sounds interesting but I don’t see how it fits the type of research I do right now.
